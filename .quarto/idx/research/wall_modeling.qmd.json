This has been observed in a variety of flows including accelerating and pulsatile flows.\n\nBelow is an animation of the driving LES pressure gradient and the lamNEQ model response.\n\n![High frequency content of the LES pressure gradient and the resulting velocity profile lamNEQ model.](dissertation/chapter3-lamNEQ-profile.gif){#fig-lamneq-profile}\n\nWe then model the laminar non-equilibrium velocity $\\bm{u}''$ by solving\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\bm{u}''}{\\partial t} = - \\frac{1}{\\rho}\n\\bm{\\nabla}_h p'' + \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 \\bm{u}''}{\\partial y^2}.\n$$ \nThe wall stress then has the solution\n$$\n{\\color{red}\\bm{\\tau}_w''}(t) = \\nu \\left. \\frac{\\partial \\bm{u}''}{\\partial y} \\right|_0\n= \\sqrt{\\nu/\\pi} \\int_{t_0}^t - \\frac{1}{\\rho}\\bm{\\nabla}_h p''(t') \\,\\,  (t - t')^{-1/2} dt'.\n$$ {#eq-lamNEQ-wall-stress}\n\nWe can now add the lamNEQ model to our length and time scale schematic.\n\n![Length and time scales for the LaRTE+lamNEQ wall model.](dissertation/chapter4-larte-lamneq-time-scale-schematic.png){#fig-larte-lamneq-length-time-scales width=100%}\n\n### turbNEQ\n\nThe final component is the turbulent non-equilibrium (turbNEQ) model. This model attempts to account for the velocity difference between the LES velocity and the LaRTE and lamNEQ models\n$$\n{\\color{green}\\bm{u}_\\Delta'}  = {\\color{gray}\\overline{\\bm{u}}_\\Delta}  - {\\color{blue}\\bm{u}_\\tau   f(\\Delta^+)} \n= \\bm{U}_{LES} - {\\color{red}\\bm{u}_{\\Delta}''} - {\\color{blue}\\bm{u}_\\tau   f(\\Delta^+)}.\n$$\nThe turbNEQ model assumes that the velocity fluctuation, $\\bm{u}_\\Delta'$, comes from near-wall turbulent flow structures such as wall attached eddies as shown in @fig-turbneq-schematic.\n\n![turbNEQ velocity profile and model](dissertation/chapter5-turbneq-schematic.png){#fig-turbneq-schematic width=100%}\n\nA simple plug-flow plus linear velocity profile is used for the model\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\bm{u}' &= \\bm{u}_\\Delta' \\frac{y}{l_s} \\quad \\textrm{for} \\quad 0 \\leq y \\leq l_s \\\\\n\\bm{u}' &= \\bm{u}_\\Delta' \\quad \\textrm{for} \\quad y \\geq l_s\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nwhich has the corresponding turbNEQ wall stress\n$$\n{\\color{green}\\bm{\\tau}_w'} \\equiv \\left. \\nu \\frac{\\partial \\bm{u}'}{\\partial y} \\right|_0 = \\frac{u_\\tau \\bm{u}_\\Delta'}{l_s^+}.\n$$ {#eq-turbNEQ-wall-stress}\nThis simple velocity profile has actually been found to be consistent with POD analysis in Hansen et al. (2022).\n\nAdding the turbNEQ model now completes the time scale schematic shown in @fig-mtswm-length-time-scales. The full MTS model with LaRTE, lamNEQ, and turbNEQ parts is just the superposition of these different parts\n$$\n\\bm{\\tau}_w(x,z,t) = {\\color{blue}\\overline{\\bm \\tau}_w}(x,z,t) + {\\color{red}\\bm{\\tau}_w''}(x,z,t) + {\\color{green}\\bm{\\tau}_w'}(x,z,t)\n$$\nwhere ${\\color{blue}\\overline{\\bm \\tau}_w}$, ${\\color{red}\\bm{\\tau}_w''}$, and ${\\color{green}\\bm{\\tau}_w'}$ are computed via @eq-larte-wall-stress, @eq-lamNEQ-wall-stress, and @eq-turbNEQ-wall-stress, respectively. This model is now applied to a variety of flows to show the usefulness of this approach.\n\n## Applications\n\n### Stationary Channel Flow\n\nFirst the MTSWM is applied to channel flow. @fig-channel-pdfs shows the wall stress probability density functions (PDFs) for stationary channel flow with $Re_\\tau = 1000, 5200$. Agreement between the LES with MTSWM and the DNS is very good for the streamwise PDFs although too wide for the spanwise PDFs. The turbNEQ model is able to properly capture the bulk of the streamwise wall stress fluctuations and the LaRTE model capture the mean. This is consistent with the turbNEQ model capturing near-wall turbulent fluctuations and the LaRTE model capturing the mean behavior. For larger Reynolds numbers the lamNEQ model has a very narrow PDFs due to its $\\sqrt{\\nu}$ scaling.\n\n![Stationary channel flow wall stress PDFs](dissertation/chapter6-channel-PDFs.png){#fig-channel-pdfs width=100%}\n\nThe MTSWM is next applied to unsteady flows to analyze the model behavior during non-equilibrium conditions.\n\n### Unsteady Flows\n\n#### Pulsatile Channel Flow\n\nFirst is pulsatile channel flow. The flow is generated by a sinusoidal pressure gradient forcing\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial P_0}{\\partial x} \\left[ 1 + \\beta \\cos \\left( \\omega_f^+ t^+ \\right) \\right].\n$$\n$\\omega_f^+$ is the non-equilibrium parameter of interest and dictates the different flow regimes outlined in @fig-pulsatile-table below.\n\n![Pulsatile channel flow forcing frequencies](dissertation/chapter6-pulsatile-frequency-table.png){#fig-pulsatile-table width=50%}\n\nThe MTSWM is tested for this flow and compared against the DNS of Weng et al. (2016). @fig-pulsatile-results shows the period wall stress (obtained using a triple decomposition) for the full range of frequencies. The MTSWM results agree quite well with the DNS for each of the forcing frequencies. The quasi-steady, intermediate, and high frequencies are highlighted to show how the different modeling components are **engaged** during the different flow regimes. The [LaRTE]{.blue} model captures the slow, quasi-steady dynamics, the [turbNEQ]{.green} model captures the intermediate frequency dynamics, and the [lamNEQ]{.red} model captures the fast, high-frequency dynamics. This is consistent with the time scale schematic of @fig-mtswm-length-time-scales. \n\n![Single period time evolution of the periodic streamwise wall-stress $\\widetilde{\\tau}_{wx}$ for several forcing frequencies, $\\omega_f^+$](dissertation/chapter6-pulsatile-results.png){#fig-pulsatile-results width=100%}\n\n#### Linearly Accelerating Channel Flow\n\nIn linearly accelerating channel flow, flow is accelerated by a pressure gradient forcing according to\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{\\partial \\langle p \\rangle^*}{\\partial x}(t^*)=\\frac{1}{2 Re_{\\tau,i}} \\frac{\\textrm{d} Re_m(t^*)}{\\textrm{d} t^*}+\\left(\\frac{Re_\\tau(t^*)}{Re_{\\tau, i}}\\right)^2\n$$\nwhere $Re_m \\equiv U_m 2h/\\nu$ is the bulk mean Reynolds number with $U_m$ being the bulk mean velocity (averaged over the entire channel). If $t^* = 0$ marks the beginning of the acceleration then $Re_m$ is set according to\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nRe_m(t^*) &= Re_{m,i} \\quad &t^* < 0 \\\\\nRe_m(t^*) &= Re_{m,i} + \\frac{t^*}{T^*} \\left( Re_{m,f} - Re_{m,i} \\right) \\quad &0 \\leq t^* < T^*\\\\\nRe_m(t^*) &= Re_{m,f} \\quad &t^* \\geq  T^*\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nwhere $T^*$, the acceleration/ramp rate, is the non-equilibrium parameter of interest. Both the initial ($Re_{m,i}$) and final ($Re_{m,f}$) The acceleration rates and their corresponding flow regime are outlined in @fig-lin-accel-table below.\n\n![Linearly accelerating channel flow acceleration rates](dissertation/chapter6-lin-accel-table.png){#fig-lin-accel-table width=50%}\n\nThe fastest acceleration rate, $T^*=0.1$, has distinct stages over the course of the acceleration, including what is referred to as \"turbulent-to-turbulent\" transition.\n\n@fig-lin-accel-results shows the skin friction and wall stress time history for the MTSWM versus DNS for the fastest acceleration rate considered. Again the MTSWM (solid black line) agrees well with the DNS (dashed black line). For this fastest acceleration we observe three different stages (colored and labeled in the left subplot):\n\n- [Laminar Stage]{.red}: The pressure gradient is changed so suddenly the skin friction is consistent with the laminar solution. This features a sharp initial rise from its initial value followed by a quick decrease.\n- [Transition Stage]{.green}: After the skin friction decays during the laminar stage, it starts to increase again, mirroring laminar-to-turbulent transition.\n- [Final Turbulent State]{.blue}: The skin friction convergest to its final turbulent state, dictated by the final bulk mean Reynolds number.\n\nWhen plotting the different model components of the MTSWM (right subplot of @fig-lin-accel-results) we can see that the different model components are \"activated\" during each of the stages. The [LaRTE]{.blue} model captures the mean wall stress before acceleration and after the flow reaches its final turbulent state. The [lamNEQ]{.red} model captures the quick spike in the skin friction during the laminar stage. And the [turbNEQ]{.green} model slowly increases the skin friction during the transition stage.\n\n![Linearly accelerating channel flow skin friction and wall stress time histories for the fastest acceleration rate, $T^* = 0.1$](dissertation/chapter6-lin-accel-results.png){#fig-lin-accel-results width=100%}\n\n### Streamwise Developing Flows\n\n#### ZPGTBL\n\nThe MTSWM is next applied to spatially developing flows to see how it performs during spatial non-equilibrium as opposed to temporal non-equilibrium.\n\nFirst the zero pressure gradient turbulent boundary layer (ZPGTBL) is simulated. The wall model is implemented in JHU's LESGO code which needed modifications in order to handle spatially developing flows. To simulate a developing boundary layer the rescale-recycle method by Lund et al. (1998) is implemented in order to achieve a turbulent inflow. The fluctuations downstream of the inlet are sampled, rescaled, and recycled to the inlet. A schematical picture of this is shown in @fig-rescale-recycle. Because LESGO is periodic, a fringe region is needed to reduce the boundary layer at the outlet and re-introduce it at the inlet. This is done via a body force (the body force formula is also privided in @fig-rescale-recycle).\n\n![Schematic of the rescale-recycle method and the fringe region](dissertation/chapter7-rescale-recycle-schematic.png){#fig-rescale-recycle width=100%}\n\nNext a ZPGTBL is simulated for a wide range of Reynolds numbers. @fig-zpgtbl-velocity-contour shows what the flow field looks like for a single Reynolds number. Figures @fig-zpgtbl-profiles and @fig-zpgtbl-skin-friction show the velocity profiles, turbulence intensities, and skin friction for all of the Reynolds numbers considered. As expected, for this flow there is little difference between the MTSWM and the EQWM (wall model baseline). The velocity profiles and turbulence intensitives follow the expected trends and the skin friction falls within 10 percent of an empirical trend. This shows the MTSWM and added modifications to the LESGO code are capable of simulating zero pressure gradient turbulent boundary layers. \n\n![Velocity contour of instantaneous streamwise velocity field for ZPGTBL](dissertation/chapter7-zpgtbl-velocity-contour.png){#fig-zpgtbl-velocity-contour width=60%}\n\n![Velocity profiles (left) and turbulence intensities (right) for ZPGTBL over several Reynolds numbers](dissertation/chapter7-zpgtbl-profiles.png){#fig-zpgtbl-profiles width=100%}\n\n![Skin friction (left) and free stream velocity in inner units  (right) for ZPGTBL over several Reynolds numbers](dissertation/chapter7-zpgtbl-skin-friction.png){#fig-zpgtbl-skin-friction width=100%}\n\n#### Separated TBL\n\nFinally, the MTSWM is applied to a separated turbulent boundary layer (TBL) based on the simulation setup of Coleman et al. (2018). The flow set-up and resulting instantaneous velocity field is shown in @fig-separation-velocity-contour. A separation bubble is formed by imposed suction (adverse pressure gradient) and blowing (favorable pressure gradient) on top boundary of the domain. This produces a weakly separated boundary layer at the center of the domain.\n\n![Velocity contour of instantaneous streamwise velocity field for separated TBL](dissertation/chapter7-separation-velocity-contour.png){#fig-separation-velocity-contour width=100%}\n\n@fig-separation-skin-friction shows the skin friction for the MTSWM compared with the DNS of Coleman et al. (2018) and the baseline EQWM. All three curves are quite similar, however, both the MTSWM and the EQWM do not predict separation. @fig-separation-gammar shows the fraction of reversed wall stress, $\\gamma_r$, (fraction of time the streamwise wall stress is negative). While the mean skin friction is never negative, instantaneously the wall stress is negative for both the MTSWM and EQWM. However the MTSWM gives a wider $\\gamma_r$ than the EQWM. In @fig-separation-animation we see this is because of the additional fluctuation contributions from the lamNEQ model. The high frequency fluctuations in the LES pressure gradient drive small-scale wall stress fluctuations by the lamNEQ model. This creates the small intermittent separation patches (white regions) observed for the total wall stress for the MTSWM.\n\n![Skin friction (left) and pressure coefficient (right) for separated TBL](dissertation/chapter7-separation-skin-friction.png){#fig-separation-skin-friction width=100%}\n\n![Fraction of reversed wall stress for separated TBL](dissertation/chapter7-separation-gamma_r.png){#fig-separation-gammar width=60%}\n\n![Instantaneous wall stress contours for separated TBL.

This has been observed in a variety of flows including accelerating and pulsatile flows.\n\nBelow is an animation of the driving LES pressure gradient and the lamNEQ model response.\n\n![High frequency content of the LES pressure gradient and the resulting velocity profile lamNEQ model.](dissertation/chapter3-lamNEQ-profile.gif){#fig-lamneq-profile}\n\nWe then model the laminar non-equilibrium velocity $\\bm{u}''$ by solving\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\bm{u}''}{\\partial t} = - \\frac{1}{\\rho}\n\\bm{\\nabla}_h p'' + \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 \\bm{u}''}{\\partial y^2}.\n$$ \nThe wall stress then has the solution\n$$\n{\\color{red}\\bm{\\tau}_w''}(t) = \\nu \\left. \\frac{\\partial \\bm{u}''}{\\partial y} \\right|_0\n= \\sqrt{\\nu/\\pi} \\int_{t_0}^t - \\frac{1}{\\rho}\\bm{\\nabla}_h p''(t') \\,\\,  (t - t')^{-1/2} dt'.\n$$ {#eq-lamNEQ-wall-stress}\n\nWe can now add the lamNEQ model to our length and time scale schematic.\n\n![Length and time scales for the LaRTE+lamNEQ wall model.](dissertation/chapter4-larte-lamneq-time-scale-schematic.png){#fig-larte-lamneq-length-time-scales width=100%}\n\n### turbNEQ\n\nThe final component is the turbulent non-equilibrium (turbNEQ) model. This model attempts to account for the velocity difference between the LES velocity and the LaRTE and lamNEQ models\n$$\n{\\color{green}\\bm{u}_\\Delta'}  = {\\color{gray}\\overline{\\bm{u}}_\\Delta}  - {\\color{blue}\\bm{u}_\\tau   f(\\Delta^+)} \n= \\bm{U}_{LES} - {\\color{red}\\bm{u}_{\\Delta}''} - {\\color{blue}\\bm{u}_\\tau   f(\\Delta^+)}.\n$$\nThe turbNEQ model assumes that the velocity fluctuation, $\\bm{u}_\\Delta'$, comes from near-wall turbulent flow structures such as wall attached eddies as shown in @fig-turbneq-schematic.\n\n![turbNEQ velocity profile and model](dissertation/chapter5-turbneq-schematic.png){#fig-turbneq-schematic width=100%}\n\nA simple plug-flow plus linear velocity profile is used for the model\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\bm{u}' &= \\bm{u}_\\Delta' \\frac{y}{l_s} \\quad \\textrm{for} \\quad 0 \\leq y \\leq l_s \\\\\n\\bm{u}' &= \\bm{u}_\\Delta' \\quad \\textrm{for} \\quad y \\geq l_s\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nwhich has the corresponding turbNEQ wall stress\n$$\n{\\color{green}\\bm{\\tau}_w'} \\equiv \\left. \\nu \\frac{\\partial \\bm{u}'}{\\partial y} \\right|_0 = \\frac{u_\\tau \\bm{u}_\\Delta'}{l_s^+}.\n$$ {#eq-turbNEQ-wall-stress}\nThis simple velocity profile has actually been found to be consistent with POD analysis in Hansen et al. (2022).\n\nAdding the turbNEQ model now completes the time scale schematic shown in @fig-mtswm-length-time-scales. The full MTS model with LaRTE, lamNEQ, and turbNEQ parts is just the superposition of these different parts\n$$\n\\bm{\\tau}_w(x,z,t) = {\\color{blue}\\overline{\\bm \\tau}_w}(x,z,t) + {\\color{red}\\bm{\\tau}_w''}(x,z,t) + {\\color{green}\\bm{\\tau}_w'}(x,z,t)\n$$\nwhere ${\\color{blue}\\overline{\\bm \\tau}_w}$, ${\\color{red}\\bm{\\tau}_w''}$, and ${\\color{green}\\bm{\\tau}_w'}$ are computed via @eq-larte-wall-stress, @eq-lamNEQ-wall-stress, and @eq-turbNEQ-wall-stress, respectively. This model is now applied to a variety of flows to show the usefulness of this approach.\n\n## Applications\n\n### Stationary Channel Flow\n\nFirst the MTSWM is applied to channel flow. @fig-channel-pdfs shows the wall stress probability density functions (PDFs) for stationary channel flow with $Re_\\tau = 1000, 5200$. Agreement between the LES with MTSWM and the DNS is very good for the streamwise PDFs although too wide for the spanwise PDFs. The turbNEQ model is able to properly capture the bulk of the streamwise wall stress fluctuations and the LaRTE model capture the mean. This is consistent with the turbNEQ model capturing near-wall turbulent fluctuations and the LaRTE model capturing the mean behavior. For larger Reynolds numbers the lamNEQ model has a very narrow PDFs due to its $\\sqrt{\\nu}$ scaling.\n\n![Stationary channel flow wall stress PDFs](dissertation/chapter6-channel-PDFs.png){#fig-channel-pdfs width=100%}\n\nThe MTSWM is next applied to unsteady flows to analyze the model behavior during non-equilibrium conditions.\n\n### Unsteady Flows\n\n#### Pulsatile Channel Flow\n\nFirst is pulsatile channel flow. The flow is generated by a sinusoidal pressure gradient forcing\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial P_0}{\\partial x} \\left[ 1 + \\beta \\cos \\left( \\omega_f^+ t^+ \\right) \\right].\n$$\n$\\omega_f^+$ is the non-equilibrium parameter of interest and dictates the different flow regimes outlined in @fig-pulsatile-table below.\n\n![Pulsatile channel flow forcing frequencies](dissertation/chapter6-pulsatile-frequency-table.png){#fig-pulsatile-table width=50%}\n\nThe MTSWM is tested for this flow and compared against the DNS of Weng et al. (2016). @fig-pulsatile-results shows the period wall stress (obtained using a triple decomposition) for the full range of frequencies. The MTSWM results agree quite well with the DNS for each of the forcing frequencies. The quasi-steady, intermediate, and high frequencies are highlighted to show how the different modeling components are **engaged** during the different flow regimes. The [LaRTE]{.blue} model captures the slow, quasi-steady dynamics, the [turbNEQ]{.green} model captures the intermediate frequency dynamics, and the [lamNEQ]{.red} model captures the fast, high-frequency dynamics. This is consistent with the time scale schematic of @fig-mtswm-length-time-scales. \n\n![Single period time evolution of the periodic streamwise wall-stress $\\widetilde{\\tau}_{wx}$ for several forcing frequencies, $\\omega_f^+$](dissertation/chapter6-pulsatile-results.png){#fig-pulsatile-results width=100%}\n\n#### Linearly Accelerating Channel Flow\n\nIn linearly accelerating channel flow, flow is accelerated by a pressure gradient forcing according to\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{\\partial \\langle p \\rangle^*}{\\partial x}(t^*)=\\frac{1}{2 Re_{\\tau,i}} \\frac{\\textrm{d} Re_m(t^*)}{\\textrm{d} t^*}+\\left(\\frac{Re_\\tau(t^*)}{Re_{\\tau, i}}\\right)^2\n$$\nwhere $Re_m \\equiv U_m 2h/\\nu$ is the bulk mean Reynolds number with $U_m$ being the bulk mean velocity (averaged over the entire channel). If $t^* = 0$ marks the beginning of the acceleration then $Re_m$ is set according to\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nRe_m(t^*) &= Re_{m,i} \\quad &t^* < 0 \\\\\nRe_m(t^*) &= Re_{m,i} + \\frac{t^*}{T^*} \\left( Re_{m,f} - Re_{m,i} \\right) \\quad &0 \\leq t^* < T^*\\\\\nRe_m(t^*) &= Re_{m,f} \\quad &t^* \\geq  T^*\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nwhere $T^*$, the acceleration/ramp rate, is the non-equilibrium parameter of interest. Both the initial ($Re_{m,i}$) and final ($Re_{m,f}$) The acceleration rates and their corresponding flow regime are outlined in @fig-lin-accel-table below.\n\n![Linearly accelerating channel flow acceleration rates](dissertation/chapter6-lin-accel-table.png){#fig-lin-accel-table width=50%}\n\nThe fastest acceleration rate, $T^*=0.1$, has distinct stages over the course of the acceleration, including what is referred to as \"turbulent-to-turbulent\" transition.\n\n@fig-lin-accel-results shows the skin friction and wall stress time history for the MTSWM versus DNS for the fastest acceleration rate considered. Again the MTSWM (solid black line) agrees well with the DNS (dashed black line). For this fastest acceleration we observe three different stages (colored and labeled in the left subplot):\n\n- [Laminar Stage]{.red}: The pressure gradient is changed so suddenly the skin friction is consistent with the laminar solution. This features a sharp initial rise from its initial value followed by a quick decrease.\n- [Transition Stage]{.green}: After the skin friction decays during the laminar stage, it starts to increase again, mirroring laminar-to-turbulent transition.\n- [Final Turbulent State]{.blue}: The skin friction convergest to its final turbulent state, dictated by the final bulk mean Reynolds number.\n\nWhen plotting the different model components of the MTSWM (right subplot of @fig-lin-accel-results) we can see that the different model components are \"activated\" during each of the stages. The [LaRTE]{.blue} model captures the mean wall stress before acceleration and after the flow reaches its final turbulent state. The [lamNEQ]{.red} model captures the quick spike in the skin friction during the laminar stage. And the [turbNEQ]{.green} model slowly increases the skin friction during the transition stage.\n\n![Linearly accelerating channel flow skin friction and wall stress time histories for the fastest acceleration rate, $T^* = 0.1$](dissertation/chapter6-lin-accel-results.png){#fig-lin-accel-results width=100%}\n\n### Streamwise Developing Flows\n\n#### ZPGTBL\n\nThe MTSWM is next applied to spatially developing flows to see how it performs during spatial non-equilibrium as opposed to temporal non-equilibrium.\n\nFirst the zero pressure gradient turbulent boundary layer (ZPGTBL) is simulated. The wall model is implemented in JHU's LESGO code which needed modifications in order to handle spatially developing flows. To simulate a developing boundary layer the rescale-recycle method by Lund et al. (1998) is implemented in order to achieve a turbulent inflow. The fluctuations downstream of the inlet are sampled, rescaled, and recycled to the inlet. A schematical picture of this is shown in @fig-rescale-recycle. Because LESGO is periodic, a fringe region is needed to reduce the boundary layer at the outlet and re-introduce it at the inlet. This is done via a body force (the body force formula is also privided in @fig-rescale-recycle).\n\n![Schematic of the rescale-recycle method and the fringe region](dissertation/chapter7-rescale-recycle-schematic.png){#fig-rescale-recycle width=100%}\n\nNext a ZPGTBL is simulated for a wide range of Reynolds numbers. @fig-zpgtbl-velocity-contour shows what the flow field looks like for a single Reynolds number. Figures @fig-zpgtbl-profiles and @fig-zpgtbl-skin-friction show the velocity profiles, turbulence intensities, and skin friction for all of the Reynolds numbers considered. As expected, for this flow there is little difference between the MTSWM and the EQWM (wall model baseline). The velocity profiles and turbulence intensitives follow the expected trends and the skin friction falls within 10 percent of an empirical trend. This shows the MTSWM and added modifications to the LESGO code are capable of simulating zero pressure gradient turbulent boundary layers. \n\n![Velocity contour of instantaneous streamwise velocity field for ZPGTBL](dissertation/chapter7-zpgtbl-velocity-contour.png){#fig-zpgtbl-velocity-contour width=60%}\n\n![Velocity profiles (left) and turbulence intensities (right) for ZPGTBL over several Reynolds numbers](dissertation/chapter7-zpgtbl-profiles.png){#fig-zpgtbl-profiles width=100%}\n\n![Skin friction (left) and free stream velocity in inner units  (right) for ZPGTBL over several Reynolds numbers](dissertation/chapter7-zpgtbl-skin-friction.png){#fig-zpgtbl-skin-friction width=100%}\n\n#### Separated TBL\n\nFinally, the MTSWM is applied to a separated turbulent boundary layer (TBL) based on the simulation setup of Coleman et al. (2018). The flow set-up and resulting instantaneous velocity field is shown in @fig-separation-velocity-contour. A separation bubble is formed by imposed suction (adverse pressure gradient) and blowing (favorable pressure gradient) on top boundary of the domain. This produces a weakly separated boundary layer at the center of the domain.\n\n![Velocity contour of instantaneous streamwise velocity field for separated TBL](dissertation/chapter7-separation-velocity-contour.png){#fig-separation-velocity-contour width=100%}\n\n@fig-separation-skin-friction shows the skin friction for the MTSWM compared with the DNS of Coleman et al. (2018) and the baseline EQWM. All three curves are quite similar, however, both the MTSWM and the EQWM do not predict separation. @fig-separation-gammar shows the fraction of reversed wall stress, $\\gamma_r$, (fraction of time the streamwise wall stress is negative). While the mean skin friction is never negative, instantaneously the wall stress is negative for both the MTSWM and EQWM. However the MTSWM gives a wider $\\gamma_r$ than the EQWM. In @fig-separation-animation we see this is because of the additional fluctuation contributions from the lamNEQ model. The high frequency fluctuations in the LES pressure gradient drive small-scale wall stress fluctuations by the lamNEQ model. This creates the small intermittent separation patches (white regions) observed for the total wall stress for the MTSWM.\n\n![Skin friction (left) and pressure coefficient (right) for separated TBL](dissertation/chapter7-separation-skin-friction.png){#fig-separation-skin-friction width=100%}\n\n![Fraction of reversed wall stress for separated TBL](dissertation/chapter7-separation-gamma_r.png){#fig-separation-gammar width=60%}\n\n![Instantaneous wall stress contours for separated TBL. From top to bottom are the total, LaRTE, lamNEQ, and turbNEQ wall stress components for the MTSWM.](dissertation/animations/MTSWM_ws_separation_bubble_cropped.gif){#fig-separation-animation width=100%}\n\nWhile the MTSWM has shown excellent resutls for homogeneous unsteady flows, further development is needed extend the model to handle separated flows. There are ongoing research efforts aimed at achieving this.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":true,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"css":["../styles.css","../assets/quiz/quiz.css"],"include-after-body":["../tooltips.html","../_includes/quiz-iframe-resize.html"],"html-math-method":"katex","output-file":"wall_modeling.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table

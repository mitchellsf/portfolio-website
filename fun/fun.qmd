## Block Jump Game

In this game you move a "block" character using the left and right arrow keys to go sideways and jump with the up arrow key. The objective is climb as high as possible while avoiding dying from falling asteroids or falling into the abyss below. You can wall jump by pressing the jump key while pressed against an asteroid (must be pressing a side arrow key before pressing jump). You can also destroy asteroids by hitting them from below.

This game is based on the game [Avalance](https://freegames.org/avalanche/).

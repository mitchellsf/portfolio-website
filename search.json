    "section": "Governing Equation",
    "text": "Governing Equation\nTo derive the governing equation for the mass’s motion we first need to write the force balance via a free body diagram. Figure 4 shows the forces acting on the mass. For positive dispacement, y&gt;0, the spring is stretched and gives a force in the negative y direction. For negative displacement, the spring is compressed and gives a force in the positive y direction. In both cases the spring force opposes the displacement, which may be written as F_s = -ky where k is the spring constant. Similarly, the damper opposes the velocity of the mass. This is just like surface friction opposing the motion of a block sliding or drag slowing a ball thrown through the air. This gives the force, F_d = -c \\dot{y}, where a dot overhead represents taking a derivative with time. The linear relationship between force and velocity is an approximation, but accurate for most applications. Finally the external force, f(t), is defined to be positive in the positive y direction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: MSD Free Body Diagram\n\n\n\n\nNext we apply Newton’s second law of motion \n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum F_y &= m a = m \\ddot{y} \\\\\n&= f - k y - c \\dot{y}\n\\end{aligned}\n\nRewriting gives the final governing equation \nm \\ddot{y} + c \\dot{y} + k y = f\n\\tag{1} This equation is a second order, linear, nonhomogeneous, ordinary differential equation (ODE) with constant coefficients. Let’s define each of these terms.\nThe order of an ODE is the highest order derivative derivative in the equation. In this case \\ddot{y} is the highest order derivative so we say the ODE is second order.\nAn ODE is linear if the coefficients of each y term and its derivatives are only functions of the independent variable. e.g. a(t)\\dot{y} is linear but y\\dot{y} is non-linear.\nA homogeneous ODE is linear but with no external forcing term. The external force, f(t), in Equation 1 makes the equation nonhomogeneous. This distinction has important implications in solution strategies. A principle feature of homogeneous ODEs is solutions can be superposed.\nAn ordinary differential equation only has derivatives with respect to one independent variable; as opposed to a partial differential equation which has derivatives with respect to two or more independent variables.\nEach of these classifications has a significant influence on solution properties and strategies. Next we’ll discuss the unforced system, f(t) = 0.",

    "text": "The Unforced System\n\nAnalytical Solution\nIn the unforced system we set f = 0 in Equation 1 and get \nm \\ddot{y} + c \\dot{y} + k y = 0\n\\tag{2}\nThis equation is now homogeneous, allowing us to apply the superposition principle to obtain the general solution.\nIn general, homogeneous ODEs with constant coeffients admit exponential solutions, i.e. solutions of the form y(t) = a e^{\\lambda t} where \\lambda is the growth/decay rate and can be complex. For example, the first-order ODE \\dot{y}+by=0 yields exponential decay y = a e^{-bt} for b&gt;0.\nThis suggests we should try to solve Equation 2 assuming y = a e^{\\lambda t}. Substituting in Equation 2 yields \na m \\lambda^2 e^{\\lambda t} + a c e^{\\lambda t} + a k e^{\\lambda t} = (m \\lambda^2 + c \\lambda + k)a e^{\\lambda t} = 0\n which is reduced to \nm \\lambda^2 + c \\lambda + k = 0.\n\\tag{3} Equation 3 is known as the characteristic equation. This can be solved using the quadratic formula \n\\lambda_{1,2} = \\frac{1}{2m}\\left( -c \\pm \\sqrt{c^2 - 4 m k} \\right)\n\\tag{4} where the subcript 1, 2 represents the fact there are two solutions to the characteristic equation corresponding to the “+” or “-” sign.\nWe’ve now solved the equation! We assumed y = a e^{\\lambda t} and found \\lambda must be Equation 4 by solving the characteristic equation. Using the superposition principle, the general solution is then \ny = a_1 e^{\\lambda_1 t} + a_2 e^{\\lambda_2 t}\n\\tag{5} The value of the constants a_1 and a_2 can be determined by the initial conditons, y(0)=y_0 and \\dot{y}(0) = v_0. Since the ODE is second-order, we need two initial conditions.\nNote in Equation 4 that if c^2 &lt; 4mk then \\lambda is complex! This has important implications on the solution behavior and will be discussed next.\n\n\n\nThe Undamped System\nFirst let’s consider the undamped case by setting c=0. Then Equation 4 becomes \n\\lambda_{1,2} = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} i = \\pm \\omega_n i\n\\tag{6} where i \\equiv \\sqrt{-1} is the imaginary number and \\omega_n is known as natural frequency of the system.\nWhat happens when \\lambda is imaginary? Recall Euler’s formula e^{ix} = \\cos x + i \\sin x. Substituting Equation 6 into Equation 5 and applying Euler’s formula yields\n\n\nShow Work\n\n\\begin{align*}\n  y &= a_1 e^{i\\omega t} + a_2 e^{-i\\omega t} \\\\\n    &= a_1 \\left( \\cos{\\omega_n t} + i \\sin{\\omega_n t} \\right) + a_2 \\left( \\cos{\\omega_n t} - i \\sin{\\omega_n t} \\right) \\\\\n    &= b_1 \\cos{\\omega_n t} + b_2 \\sin{\\omega_n t}\n  \\end{align*} where the definitions b_1 \\equiv a_1 + a_2 and b_2 \\equiv (a_1 - a_2) i are made.\nIn order for b_1 and b_2 to be real numbers, a_1 and a_2 must be complex conjugates of each other, a_2 = \\overline{a_1}.\nThe choice of variable names is arbitrary so we return to using a_1 and a_2 in the final equation.\n\n\ny = a_1 \\cos{\\omega_n t} + a_2 \\sin{\\omega_n t}\n Once again we can solve for a_1 and a_2 given the initial conditions. This gives the final solution. \ny = y_0 \\cos{\\omega_n t} + \\frac{v_0}{\\omega_n} \\sin{\\omega_n t}\n\\tag{7}\nNow let’s explore the behavior of this solution via the interactive figure below.\n\n\n\n\nThrough this demo we’ve shown that the undamped solution is sinusoidal with frequency \\omega_n which is inherent to the system’s properties (mass and spring consant) and NOT the initial conditions.\nAn undamped system is unrealistic, however. There is always some source of friction or dissipation which decays motion. Next we’ll show how damping affects solution behavior.\n\n\nThe Damped System\nRecall the solution, \\lambda_{1,2}, to the characteristic equation, Equation 4. We had hinted that the behavior of the solution depends on the magnitude of c^2 versus 4mk. In other words, the strength of the damping plays critical role in the behavior of the MSD system.\nThe analysis is symplified if we introduce a new parameter \\zeta defined to be \n\\zeta \\equiv \\frac{c}{2m\\omega_n}\n where \\omega_n \\equiv \\sqrt{k/n} is the natural frequency from the undamped case. Using these definitions simplifies the characteristics: \n\\lambda_{1,2} = \\omega_n \\left( -\\zeta \\pm \\sqrt{\\zeta^2 - 1} \\right).\n Now it’s clear that the solution behavior (real or complex) only depends on the parameter \\zeta. Note \\zeta is essentially a non-dimensional damping coefficient.\nLet’s see how the solution changes now that we’ve introduced this new parameter.\n\n\n\n\nNow that we qualitatively understand the different behavior between under, over, and critically damped systems, let’s look into the specifics of each.\n\nUnderdamped\nFor \\zeta &lt; 1 the system is underdamped and the solution is oscillatory with an exponentially decaying amplitude.\n\n\nCritically Damped\n\n\nOverdamped\nWe’ve shown that there are three distinct solution behaviors: - Underdamped (\\zeta &lt; 1): solution is oscillatory with an exponentially decaying amplitude. Reaches target (y=0) quickly but overshoots it (v \\neq 0). - Critically Damped (\\zeta = 1): solution is non-oscillatory with fast exponential decay from initial conditions. This corresponds with the least amount of time to reach stationary conditions (y=0, v=0). - Overdamped (\\zeta &gt; 1): solution is non-oscillatory with slow exponential decay from initial conditions.\nLet’s see the actual solution expressions for each of these scenarios: \n\\begin{align}\n\\textrm{Underdamped} \\; (\\zeta &lt; 1)&: y = e^{-\\omega_n \\zeta} \\left( a_1 \\cos \\omega_d t + a_2 \\sin \\omega_d t \\right), \\quad \\omega_d = \\omega_n \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2} \\\\\n\\textrm{Critically Damped} \\; (\\zeta = 1)&: y = (a_1 + a_2 t) e^{-\\omega_n t} \\\\\n\\textrm{Overdamped} \\; (\\zeta &gt; 1)&: y = a_1 e^{-\\omega_n t \\left( \\zeta + \\sqrt{\\zeta^2-1}\\right)} + a_2 e^{-\\omega_n t \\left( \\zeta - \\sqrt{\\zeta^2-1} \\right)}\n\\end{align}\n\nEach of the three damping states can be the goal of an engineering system, depending on the context. - Underdamped: For robot arms quick motion is essential and controllers can respond to the slight overshooting from underdamping. This makes underdamping better than overdamping which leads to a large between the target and response. - Critically Damped: For door closers you want the door to close as quickly as possible without slamming shut. If underdamped, the door slams shut or oscillates. If overdamped, the door takes too long to close. - Overdamped: A shock absorber is specifically designed to suddenly slow hard impact scenarios. For pneumatic or hydraulic cylinders shock absorbers bring the cylinder to rest at the end of the stroke to prevent oscillations or rebounds that can damage sensors and fixtures. Here it is better to “error on the side of caution” otherwise other components can be damaged.",

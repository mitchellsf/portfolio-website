    "text": "This page highlights the main equations and findings from the Multi-Time-Scale Wall Model (MTSWM) for Large Eddy Simulations (LES) developed during my PhD.\nThis work is based on the articles:\n\nFowler, Zaki, Meneveau (2022) - LaRTE Wall Model\nFowler, Zaki, Meneveau (2023) - Multi-Time-Scale Wall Model\n\nauthored by myself and my PhD advisors (Prof. Charles Meneveau and Prof. Tamer Zaki) and published by JFM as open access content.\nAdditional information can be found in my dissertation:\n\nDissertation JHU Library Download.\nDissertation Defense Slides.\n\n\n\nLarge Eddy Simulations (LES) are becoming an increasingly relevant tool in engineering applications as computational abilities have improved. Figure 1 shows some LES engineering applications being pursued today. These include the aerospace industry where LES is being used to simulate flow over a full aircraft and wall resolved LES of a prolate spheroid, the canonical geometry for flow over Naval vehicles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: LES: a high fidelity tool for engineering applications\n\n\n\nThe focus of this research is unsteady or non-stationary flows. Figure 2 shows some real-world examples and their corresponding canonical test cases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Unsteady flow examples\n\n\n\nWall modeling can significantly reduce the resolution requirements and overall computation cost. Choi and Moin (2012) showed wall modeled vs wall resolved LES can give an O(Re_{L_x} reduction in the number of grid points required. This allows LES to be performed at higher Reynolds numbers, making it a more feasible tool for engineering analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Resolution requirements for wall resolved versus wall modeled LES\n\n\n\nIn wall modeling the goal is to replace the unresolved near-wall physics with a simplified model. This is typically done by utilizing known behavior (such as the law-of-the-wall) and relating the wall stress to LES inputs (like velocity and pressure gradient) located some height of the wall, called the wall modeling height. The modeled wall stress is then applied as a boundary condition to the LES. This general modeling concept is represented in Figure 4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Schematic of wall modeled LES\n\n\n\nThe most widely used wall model is called the equilibrium wall model (EQWM), named so because it assumes shear stress are in equilibrium in the wall modeling region. The common approach is to assume the velocity profile follows the log-law \nU_{LES}/\\tau_w^{1/2} = \\frac{1}{\\kappa} \\log \\left( \\frac{\\Delta \\tau_w^{1/2}}{\\nu} \\right) + B\n and then to iteratively solve for the wall stress, \\tau_w. This model, however, has been shown to perform poorly during non-equilibrium conditions. This led the development of the MTSWM, discussed next.\n\n\n\nThe MTSWM is motivated by the ansatz that the near-wall flow dynamics can be decomposed into different parts depending on their corresponding time scales. Below is a schematic outlining the time scales of the near-wall and the corresponding MTS wall modeling components modeling those dynamics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Length and time scales for the MTSWM.\n\n\n\nThe total wall-shear-stress is modeled as the sum of three components:\n\nQuasi-equilibrium (LaRTE) Model: slow dynamics with time scales larger than the relaxation time scale, T_s\nLaminar Non-equilibrium (lamNEQ) Model: fast dynamics occuring inside the laminar viscous sublayer with dynamics faster than the viscous time scale, t_\\nu\nTurbulent Non-equilibrium (turbNEQ) Model: intermediate time scales, characteristic of turbulent fluctuations from near-wall eddies\n\nEach of these components has an associated velocity profile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Velocity profiles for the (a) LaRTE, (b) lamNEQ, and (c) turbNEQ models\n\n\n\nNext we’ll outline these different components to the wall model and how they lead to the full MTS model.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Lagrangian Relaxation Towards Equilibrium (LaRTE) model was motivated by capturing quasi-equilibrium dynamics. The main ansatz is that slow dynamics satisfy the law of the wall: \n\\overline{\\bm{u}} = \\overline{\\bm{u}}_s + \\overline{v} \\bm{\\hat{\\jmath}}  \\quad \\textrm{where} \\quad \\overline{\\bm{u}}_s = \\bm{u}_\\tau (x,z,t) f(y^+)\n\\tag{1} The goal is then to find an evolution equation for the wall stress \n{\\color{blue}\\overline{\\bm{\\tau}}_w} = u_\\tau \\bm{u}_\\tau.\n\\tag{2}\nThe animation below demonstrates how the LaRTE model captures the slow dynamics from a fast input \\overline{\\bm{u}}_\\Delta\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: LaRTE schematic and animation based on real LES data and model response.\n\n\n\nThe evolution equation for the LaRTE wall stress is found by substituting Equation 1 into the RANS equation, vertically integrating, then simplified to get \n\\frac{\\partial  {\\bm{u}}_\\tau}{\\partial t} + {\\bm V}_\\tau \\cdot \\bm{\\nabla}_h {\\bm{u}}_\\tau\n=  \\frac{1}{T_s} \\left[ \\frac{\\overline{\\bm \\tau}_w^{\\rm eq}}{u_\\tau} - {\\bm u}_\\tau\\right]\\, + \\, u_\\tau \\frac{\\delta^*_\\Delta}{\\Delta} \\frac{\\partial {\\bm s}}{\\partial t}\n where \nT_s \\equiv f(\\Delta^+) \\, \\frac{\\Delta }{u_\\tau}\n is called the relaxation time scale and \n\\overline{\\bm \\tau}_w^{\\rm eq} = -\\frac{\\Delta}{\\rho} \\bm{\\nabla}_h \\overline{p} + \\overline{\\bm{\\tau}}_\\Delta\n is the equilibrium wall stress.\n\nAnalyzing this equation shows the friction velocity u_\\tau relaxes (in a Lagrangian sense) towards its equilibrium value at the relaxation time scale T_s. This motivated the name “Lagrangian Relaxation Towards Equilibrium” (LaRTE) wall model.\nWe can now add the LaRTE model to the length and time scale schematic from before:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Length and time scales for the LaRTE wall model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe laminar non-equilibrium (lamNEQ) model is motivated by the fact that quick changes in pressure gradient generate a laminar Stokes layer near the wall. This has been observed in a variety of flows including accelerating and pulsatile flows.\nBelow is an animation of the driving LES pressure gradient and the lamNEQ model response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: High frequency content of the LES pressure gradient and the resulting velocity profile lamNEQ model.\n\n\n\nWe then model the laminar non-equilibrium velocity \\bm{u}'' by solving \n\\frac{\\partial \\bm{u}''}{\\partial t} = - \\frac{1}{\\rho}\n\\bm{\\nabla}_h p'' + \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 \\bm{u}''}{\\partial y^2}.\n The wall stress then has the solution \n{\\color{red}\\bm{\\tau}_w''}(t) = \\nu \\left. \\frac{\\partial \\bm{u}''}{\\partial y} \\right|_0\n= \\sqrt{\\nu/\\pi} \\int_{t_0}^t - \\frac{1}{\\rho}\\bm{\\nabla}_h p''(t') \\,\\,  (t - t')^{-1/2} dt'.\n\\tag{3}\nWe can now add the lamNEQ model to our length and time scale schematic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Length and time scales for the LaRTE+lamNEQ wall model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final component is the turbulent non-equilibrium (turbNEQ) model. This model attempts to account for the velocity difference between the LES velocity and the LaRTE and lamNEQ models \n{\\color{green}\\bm{u}_\\Delta'}  = {\\color{gray}\\overline{\\bm{u}}_\\Delta}  - {\\color{blue}\\bm{u}_\\tau   f(\\Delta^+)}\n= \\bm{U}_{LES} - {\\color{red}\\bm{u}_{\\Delta}''} - {\\color{blue}\\bm{u}_\\tau   f(\\Delta^+)}.\n The turbNEQ model assumes that the velocity fluctuation, \\bm{u}_\\Delta', comes from near-wall turbulent flow structures such as wall attached eddies as shown in Figure 11.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: turbNEQ velocity profile and model\n\n\n\nA simple plug-flow plus linear velocity profile is used for the model \n\\begin{align*}\n\\bm{u}' &= \\bm{u}_\\Delta' \\frac{y}{l_s} \\quad \\textrm{for} \\quad 0 \\leq y \\leq l_s \\\\\n\\bm{u}' &= \\bm{u}_\\Delta' \\quad \\textrm{for} \\quad y \\geq l_s\n\\end{align*}\n which has the corresponding turbNEQ wall stress \n{\\color{green}\\bm{\\tau}_w'} \\equiv \\left. \\nu \\frac{\\partial \\bm{u}'}{\\partial y} \\right|_0 = \\frac{u_\\tau \\bm{u}_\\Delta'}{l_s^+}.\n\\tag{4} This simple velocity profile has actually been found to be consistent with POD analysis in Hansen et al. (2022).\nAdding the turbNEQ model now completes the time scale schematic shown in Figure 5. The full MTS model with LaRTE, lamNEQ, and turbNEQ parts is just the superposition of these different parts \n\\bm{\\tau}_w(x,z,t) = {\\color{blue}\\overline{\\bm \\tau}_w}(x,z,t) + {\\color{red}\\bm{\\tau}_w''}(x,z,t) + {\\color{green}\\bm{\\tau}_w'}(x,z,t)\n where {\\color{blue}\\overline{\\bm \\tau}_w}, {\\color{red}\\bm{\\tau}_w''}, and {\\color{green}\\bm{\\tau}_w'} are computed via Equation 2, Equation 3, and Equation 4, respectively. This model is now applied to a variety of flows to show the usefulness of this approach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst the MTSWM is applied to channel flow. Figure 12 shows the wall stress probability density functions (PDFs) for stationary channel flow with Re_\\tau = 1000, 5200. Agreement between the LES with MTSWM and the DNS is very good for the streamwise PDFs although too wide for the spanwise PDFs. The turbNEQ model is able to properly capture the bulk of the streamwise wall stress fluctuations and the LaRTE model capture the mean. This is consistent with the turbNEQ model capturing near-wall turbulent fluctuations and the LaRTE model capturing the mean behavior. For larger Reynolds numbers the lamNEQ model has a very narrow PDFs due to its \\sqrt{\\nu} scaling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Stationary channel flow wall stress PDFs\n\n\n\nThe MTSWM is next applied to unsteady flows to analyze the model behavior during non-equilibrium conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst is pulsatile channel flow. The flow is generated by a sinusoidal pressure gradient forcing \n\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial P_0}{\\partial x} \\left[ 1 + \\beta \\cos \\left( \\omega_f^+ t^+ \\right) \\right].\n \\omega_f^+ is the non-equilibrium parameter of interest and dictates the different flow regimes outlined in Figure 13 below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Pulsatile channel flow forcing frequencies\n\n\n\nThe MTSWM is tested for this flow and compared against the DNS of Weng et al. (2016). Figure 14 shows the period wall stress (obtained using a triple decomposition) for the full range of frequencies. The MTSWM results agree quite well with the DNS for each of the forcing frequencies. The quasi-steady, intermediate, and high frequencies are highlighted to show how the different modeling components are engaged during the different flow regimes. The LaRTE model captures the slow, quasi-steady dynamics, the turbNEQ model captures the intermediate frequency dynamics, and the lamNEQ model captures the fast, high-frequency dynamics. This is consistent with the time scale schematic of Figure 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: Single period time evolution of the periodic streamwise wall-stress \\widetilde{\\tau}_{wx} for several forcing frequencies, \\omega_f^+\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn linearly accelerating channel flow, flow is accelerated by a pressure gradient forcing according to \n-\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{\\partial \\langle p \\rangle^*}{\\partial x}(t^*)=\\frac{1}{2 Re_{\\tau,i}} \\frac{\\textrm{d} Re_m(t^*)}{\\textrm{d} t^*}+\\left(\\frac{Re_\\tau(t^*)}{Re_{\\tau, i}}\\right)^2\n where Re_m \\equiv U_m 2h/\\nu is the bulk mean Reynolds number with U_m being the bulk mean velocity (averaged over the entire channel). If t^* = 0 marks the beginning of the acceleration then Re_m is set according to \n\\begin{align*}\nRe_m(t^*) &= Re_{m,i} \\quad &t^* &lt; 0 \\\\\nRe_m(t^*) &= Re_{m,i} + \\frac{t^*}{T^*} \\left( Re_{m,f} - Re_{m,i} \\right) \\quad &0 \\leq t^* &lt; T^*\\\\\nRe_m(t^*) &= Re_{m,f} \\quad &t^* \\geq  T^*\n\\end{align*}\n where T^*, the acceleration/ramp rate, is the non-equilibrium parameter of interest. Both the initial (Re_{m,i}) and final (Re_{m,f}) The acceleration rates and their corresponding flow regime are outlined in Figure 15 below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15: Linearly accelerating channel flow acceleration rates\n\n\n\nThe fastest acceleration rate, T^*=0.1, has distinct stages over the course of the acceleration, including what is referred to as “turbulent-to-turbulent” transition.\nFigure 16 shows the skin friction and wall stress time history for the MTSWM versus DNS for the fastest acceleration rate considered. Again the MTSWM (solid black line) agrees well with the DNS (dashed black line). For this fastest acceleration we observe three different stages (colored and labeled in the left subplot):\n\nLaminar Stage: The pressure gradient is changed so suddenly the skin friction is consistent with the laminar solution. This features a sharp initial rise from its initial value followed by a quick decrease.\nTransition Stage: After the skin friction decays during the laminar stage, it starts to increase again, mirroring laminar-to-turbulent transition.\nFinal Turbulent State: The skin friction convergest to its final turbulent state, dictated by the final bulk mean Reynolds number.\n\nWhen plotting the different model components of the MTSWM (right subplot of Figure 16) we can see that the different model components are “activated” during each of the stages. The LaRTE model captures the mean wall stress before acceleration and after the flow reaches its final turbulent state. The lamNEQ model captures the quick spike in the skin friction during the laminar stage. And the turbNEQ model slowly increases the skin friction during the transition stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16: Linearly accelerating channel flow skin friction and wall stress time histories for the fastest acceleration rate, T^* = 0.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe MTSWM is next applied to spatially developing flows to see how it performs during spatial non-equilibrium as opposed to temporal non-equilibrium.\nFirst the zero pressure gradient turbulent boundary layer (ZPGTBL) is simulated. The wall model is implemented in JHU’s LESGO code which needed modifications in order to handle spatially developing flows. To simulate a developing boundary layer the rescale-recycle method by Lund et al. (1998) is implemented in order to achieve a turbulent inflow. The fluctuations downstream of the inlet are sampled, rescaled, and recycled to the inlet. A schematical picture of this is shown in Figure 17. Because LESGO is periodic, a fringe region is needed to reduce the boundary layer at the outlet and re-introduce it at the inlet. This is done via a body force (the body force formula is also privided in Figure 17).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17: Schematic of the rescale-recycle method and the fringe region\n\n\n\nNext a ZPGTBL is simulated for a wide range of Reynolds numbers. Figure 18 shows what the flow field looks like for a single Reynolds number. Figures Figure 19 and Figure 20 show the velocity profiles, turbulence intensities, and skin friction for all of the Reynolds numbers considered. As expected, for this flow there is little difference between the MTSWM and the EQWM (wall model baseline). The velocity profiles and turbulence intensitives follow the expected trends and the skin friction falls within 10 percent of an empirical trend. This shows the MTSWM and added modifications to the LESGO code are capable of simulating zero pressure gradient turbulent boundary layers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18: Velocity contour of instantaneous streamwise velocity field for ZPGTBL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19: Velocity profiles (left) and turbulence intensities (right) for ZPGTBL over several Reynolds numbers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20: Skin friction (left) and free stream velocity in inner units (right) for ZPGTBL over several Reynolds numbers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the MTSWM is applied to a separated turbulent boundary layer (TBL) based on the simulation setup of Coleman et al. (2018). The flow set-up and resulting instantaneous velocity field is shown in Figure 21. A separation bubble is formed by imposed suction (adverse pressure gradient) and blowing (favorable pressure gradient) on top boundary of the domain. This produces a weakly separated boundary layer at the center of the domain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21: Velocity contour of instantaneous streamwise velocity field for separated TBL\n\n\n\nFigure 22 shows the skin friction for the MTSWM compared with the DNS of Coleman et al. (2018) and the baseline EQWM. All three curves are quite similar, however, both the MTSWM and the EQWM do not predict separation. Figure 23 shows the fraction of reversed wall stress, \\gamma_r, (fraction of time the streamwise wall stress is negative). While the mean skin friction is never negative, instantaneously the wall stress is negative for both the MTSWM and EQWM. However the MTSWM gives a wider \\gamma_r than the EQWM. In Figure 24 we see this is because of the additional fluctuation contributions from the lamNEQ model. The high frequency fluctuations in the LES pressure gradient drive small-scale wall stress fluctuations by the lamNEQ model. This creates the small intermittent separation patches (white regions) observed for the total wall stress for the MTSWM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22: Skin friction (left) and pressure coefficient (right) for separated TBL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 23: Fraction of reversed wall stress for separated TBL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 24: Instantaneous wall stress contours for separated TBL. From top to bottom are the total, LaRTE, lamNEQ, and turbNEQ wall stress components for the MTSWM.\n\n\n\nWhile the MTSWM has shown excellent resutls for homogeneous unsteady flows, further development is needed extend the model to handle separated flows. There are ongoing research efforts aimed at achieving this.",

    "text": "First the MTSWM is applied to channel flow. Figure 12 shows the wall stress probability density functions (PDFs) for stationary channel flow with Re_\\tau = 1000, 5200. Agreement between the LES with MTSWM and the DNS is very good for the streamwise PDFs although too wide for the spanwise PDFs. The turbNEQ model is able to properly capture the bulk of the streamwise wall stress fluctuations and the LaRTE model capture the mean. This is consistent with the turbNEQ model capturing near-wall turbulent fluctuations and the LaRTE model capturing the mean behavior. For larger Reynolds numbers the lamNEQ model has a very narrow PDFs due to its \\sqrt{\\nu} scaling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Stationary channel flow wall stress PDFs\n\n\n\nThe MTSWM is next applied to unsteady flows to analyze the model behavior during non-equilibrium conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst is pulsatile channel flow. The flow is generated by a sinusoidal pressure gradient forcing \n\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial P_0}{\\partial x} \\left[ 1 + \\beta \\cos \\left( \\omega_f^+ t^+ \\right) \\right].\n \\omega_f^+ is the non-equilibrium parameter of interest and dictates the different flow regimes outlined in Figure 13 below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Pulsatile channel flow forcing frequencies\n\n\n\nThe MTSWM is tested for this flow and compared against the DNS of Weng et al. (2016). Figure 14 shows the period wall stress (obtained using a triple decomposition) for the full range of frequencies. The MTSWM results agree quite well with the DNS for each of the forcing frequencies. The quasi-steady, intermediate, and high frequencies are highlighted to show how the different modeling components are engaged during the different flow regimes. The LaRTE model captures the slow, quasi-steady dynamics, the turbNEQ model captures the intermediate frequency dynamics, and the lamNEQ model captures the fast, high-frequency dynamics. This is consistent with the time scale schematic of Figure 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: Single period time evolution of the periodic streamwise wall-stress \\widetilde{\\tau}_{wx} for several forcing frequencies, \\omega_f^+\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn linearly accelerating channel flow, flow is accelerated by a pressure gradient forcing according to \n-\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{\\partial \\langle p \\rangle^*}{\\partial x}(t^*)=\\frac{1}{2 Re_{\\tau,i}} \\frac{\\textrm{d} Re_m(t^*)}{\\textrm{d} t^*}+\\left(\\frac{Re_\\tau(t^*)}{Re_{\\tau, i}}\\right)^2\n where Re_m \\equiv U_m 2h/\\nu is the bulk mean Reynolds number with U_m being the bulk mean velocity (averaged over the entire channel). If t^* = 0 marks the beginning of the acceleration then Re_m is set according to \n\\begin{align*}\nRe_m(t^*) &= Re_{m,i} \\quad &t^* &lt; 0 \\\\\nRe_m(t^*) &= Re_{m,i} + \\frac{t^*}{T^*} \\left( Re_{m,f} - Re_{m,i} \\right) \\quad &0 \\leq t^* &lt; T^*\\\\\nRe_m(t^*) &= Re_{m,f} \\quad &t^* \\geq  T^*\n\\end{align*}\n where T^*, the acceleration/ramp rate, is the non-equilibrium parameter of interest. Both the initial (Re_{m,i}) and final (Re_{m,f}) The acceleration rates and their corresponding flow regime are outlined in Figure 15 below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15: Linearly accelerating channel flow acceleration rates\n\n\n\nThe fastest acceleration rate, T^*=0.1, has distinct stages over the course of the acceleration, including what is referred to as “turbulent-to-turbulent” transition.\nFigure 16 shows the skin friction and wall stress time history for the MTSWM versus DNS for the fastest acceleration rate considered. Again the MTSWM (solid black line) agrees well with the DNS (dashed black line). For this fastest acceleration we observe three different stages (colored and labeled in the left subplot):\n\nLaminar Stage: The pressure gradient is changed so suddenly the skin friction is consistent with the laminar solution. This features a sharp initial rise from its initial value followed by a quick decrease.\nTransition Stage: After the skin friction decays during the laminar stage, it starts to increase again, mirroring laminar-to-turbulent transition.\nFinal Turbulent State: The skin friction convergest to its final turbulent state, dictated by the final bulk mean Reynolds number.\n\nWhen plotting the different model components of the MTSWM (right subplot of Figure 16) we can see that the different model components are “activated” during each of the stages. The LaRTE model captures the mean wall stress before acceleration and after the flow reaches its final turbulent state. The lamNEQ model captures the quick spike in the skin friction during the laminar stage. And the turbNEQ model slowly increases the skin friction during the transition stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16: Linearly accelerating channel flow skin friction and wall stress time histories for the fastest acceleration rate, T^* = 0.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe MTSWM is next applied to spatially developing flows to see how it performs during spatial non-equilibrium as opposed to temporal non-equilibrium.\nFirst the zero pressure gradient turbulent boundary layer (ZPGTBL) is simulated. The wall model is implemented in JHU’s LESGO code which needed modifications in order to handle spatially developing flows. To simulate a developing boundary layer the rescale-recycle method by Lund et al. (1998) is implemented in order to achieve a turbulent inflow. The fluctuations downstream of the inlet are sampled, rescaled, and recycled to the inlet. A schematical picture of this is shown in Figure 17. Because LESGO is periodic, a fringe region is needed to reduce the boundary layer at the outlet and re-introduce it at the inlet. This is done via a body force (the body force formula is also privided in Figure 17).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17: Schematic of the rescale-recycle method and the fringe region\n\n\n\nNext a ZPGTBL is simulated for a wide range of Reynolds numbers. Figure 18 shows what the flow field looks like for a single Reynolds number. Figures Figure 19 and Figure 20 show the velocity profiles, turbulence intensities, and skin friction for all of the Reynolds numbers considered. As expected, for this flow there is little difference between the MTSWM and the EQWM (wall model baseline). The velocity profiles and turbulence intensitives follow the expected trends and the skin friction falls within 10 percent of an empirical trend. This shows the MTSWM and added modifications to the LESGO code are capable of simulating zero pressure gradient turbulent boundary layers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18: Velocity contour of instantaneous streamwise velocity field for ZPGTBL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19: Velocity profiles (left) and turbulence intensities (right) for ZPGTBL over several Reynolds numbers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20: Skin friction (left) and free stream velocity in inner units (right) for ZPGTBL over several Reynolds numbers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the MTSWM is applied to a separated turbulent boundary layer (TBL) based on the simulation setup of Coleman et al. (2018). The flow set-up and resulting instantaneous velocity field is shown in Figure 21. A separation bubble is formed by imposed suction (adverse pressure gradient) and blowing (favorable pressure gradient) on top boundary of the domain. This produces a weakly separated boundary layer at the center of the domain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21: Velocity contour of instantaneous streamwise velocity field for separated TBL\n\n\n\nFigure 22 shows the skin friction for the MTSWM compared with the DNS of Coleman et al. (2018) and the baseline EQWM. All three curves are quite similar, however, both the MTSWM and the EQWM do not predict separation. Figure 23 shows the fraction of reversed wall stress, \\gamma_r, (fraction of time the streamwise wall stress is negative). While the mean skin friction is never negative, instantaneously the wall stress is negative for both the MTSWM and EQWM. However the MTSWM gives a wider \\gamma_r than the EQWM. In Figure 24 we see this is because of the additional fluctuation contributions from the lamNEQ model. The high frequency fluctuations in the LES pressure gradient drive small-scale wall stress fluctuations by the lamNEQ model. This creates the small intermittent separation patches (white regions) observed for the total wall stress for the MTSWM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22: Skin friction (left) and pressure coefficient (right) for separated TBL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 23: Fraction of reversed wall stress for separated TBL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 24: Instantaneous wall stress contours for separated TBL. From top to bottom are the total, LaRTE, lamNEQ, and turbNEQ wall stress components for the MTSWM.\n\n\n\nWhile the MTSWM has shown excellent resutls for homogeneous unsteady flows, further development is needed extend the model to handle separated flows. There are ongoing research efforts aimed at achieving this.",

    "text": "Background\nThe mass-spring-damper (MSD) system is a simplified mathematical model of many real-world systems. Figure 1 shows the basic system considered. The objective is to find the motion of the mass as a function of time. The mass is connected to the wall via a spring which provides a restoring force when stretched and a resisting force when compressed. This motion is opposed by a damper, which is represented by wall friction in Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: MSD General Schematic\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 shows the MSD system at three different states: when the mass is at rest t&lt;0, the motion’s initial conditions t=0, and once motion begins t&gt;0. When the mass is at rest (in an equilibrium state), the spring is stretched by length L. It’s convenient to define our coordinate system, y, based on position of the mass at its rest state so that displacement represents the distance from equilibrium. At t=0, the mass is displaced by a distance y_0 with velocity v_0. This causes the mass to move for t &gt; 0. Once in motion, we can have either an unforced system or a forced system with the external force f(t).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: MSD Moving Schematic\n\n\n\n\nTo gain an understanding of the real-world applications, we’ll now consider four examples of MSD systems (shown in Figure 3 along with a table summary Table 1):\n\nDoor closer - Opening the door loads a spring in the door closer mechanism, storing energy; when released, the spring drives the door shut while a hydraulic piston forces oil through a small orifice, providing damping that prevents the door from slamming.\nBike front suspension - A bump compresses the fork, increasing pressure in the air chamber (spring) that stores energy and pushes the fork back out, while a hydraulic damper controls oil flow to limit how quickly the fork compresses and rebounds so the bike doesn’t bounce.\nBuilding - A building sways like a mass-spring-damper in wind or earthquakes, with the structure’s mass moving against the stiffness of columns/walls (spring) and energy lost through material/structural damping (damper). In extreme cases the wind forcing frequency can achieve resonance with the building’s natural frequency, which can have catastrophic consequences. Some very tall buildings counter this with a tuned mass damper (TMD).\nRLC circuit - An RLC circuit is the electrical analog of a mass-spring-damper, where inductance acts like mass (inertia), capacitance like a spring (stored energy), and resistance like damping (energy dissipation).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: MSD Real-World Examples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: MSD real-world examples and their physical analogies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\nMotion\nMass\nSpring\nDamper\nForce\n\n\n\n\nDoor Closer\npiston moving\ndoor\ninternal spring\nhydraulic damping\npushing door\n\n\nBike Suspension\nvertical motion of bike\nbike frame\ncoil/air spring\nhydraulic damper (oil)\nbumpy ground\n\n\nBuilding\nsway\nbuilding\nstiffness\nstructural damping\nwind\n\n\nRLC Circuit\ncurrent\ninductance\nelastance (1/C)\nresistor\napplied voltage"

    "section": "Governing Equation",
    "text": "Governing Equation\nTo derive the governing equation for the mass’s motion, we first write a force balance via a free body diagram. Figure 4 shows the forces acting on the mass. For positive displacement, y&gt;0, the spring is stretched and gives a force in the negative y direction. For negative displacement, the spring is compressed and gives a force in the positive y direction. In both cases the spring force opposes the displacement, which may be written as F_s = -ky where k is the spring constant. Similarly, the damper opposes the velocity of the mass. This is just like surface friction opposing the motion of a block sliding or drag slowing a ball thrown through the air. This gives the force F_d = -c \\dot{y}, where an overhead dot denotes a derivative with respect to time. The linear relationship between force and velocity is an approximation, but accurate for most applications. Finally the external force, f(t), is defined to be positive in the positive y direction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: MSD Free Body Diagram\n\n\n\n\nNext we apply Newton’s second law of motion \n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum F_y &= m a = m \\ddot{y} \\\\\n&= f(t) - k y - c \\dot{y}\n\\end{aligned}\n\nRewriting gives the final governing equation \nm \\ddot{y} + c \\dot{y} + k y = f(t)\n\\tag{1} This equation is a second-order, linear, nonhomogeneous ordinary differential equation (ODE) with constant coefficients. Let’s define each of these terms.\nThe order of an ODE is the highest order derivative in the equation. In this case \\ddot{y} is the highest order derivative, so the ODE is second order.\nAn ODE is linear if y and its derivatives appear only to the first power and are not multiplied together; coefficients may depend on the independent variable. For example, a(t)\\dot{y} is linear but y\\dot{y} is nonlinear. A principal feature of linear ODEs is solutions can be superposed.\nA homogeneous ODE is linear but with no external forcing term. The external force, f(t), in Equation 1 makes the equation nonhomogeneous. This distinction has important implications in solution strategies.\nAn ordinary differential equation only has derivatives with respect to one independent variable; as opposed to a partial differential equation which has derivatives with respect to two or more independent variables.\nEach of these classifications has a significant influence on solution properties and strategies. Next we’ll discuss the unforced system, f(t) = 0."

    "text": "The Unforced System\nIn the unforced system, the motion is driven only by the initial displacement and velocity (no external force). This section shows how the solution depends on damping and how to interpret the resulting time response.\n\nAnalytical Solution\nIn the unforced system we set f = 0 in Equation 1 and get \nm \\ddot{y} + c \\dot{y} + k y = 0\n\\tag{2}\nThis equation is now homogeneous, allowing us to apply the superposition principle to obtain the general solution.\nIn general, homogeneous ODEs with constant coefficients admit exponential solutions, i.e. solutions of the form y(t) = a e^{\\lambda t} where \\lambda is the growth/decay rate and can be complex. For example, the first-order ODE \\dot{y}+by=0 yields exponential decay y = a e^{-bt} for b&gt;0.\nThis suggests we should try to solve Equation 2 assuming y = a e^{\\lambda t}. Substituting in Equation 2 yields \na m \\lambda^2 e^{\\lambda t} + a c \\lambda e^{\\lambda t} + a k e^{\\lambda t} = (m \\lambda^2 + c \\lambda + k)a e^{\\lambda t} = 0\n which is reduced to \nm \\lambda^2 + c \\lambda + k = 0.\n\\tag{3} Equation 3 is known as the characteristic equation. This can be solved using the quadratic formula \n\\lambda_{1,2} = \\frac{1}{2m}\\left( -c \\pm \\sqrt{c^2 - 4 m k} \\right)\n\\tag{4} where the subscript 1, 2 represents the fact there are two solutions to the characteristic equation corresponding to the “+” or “-” sign.\nWe’ve now solved the equation! We assumed y = a e^{\\lambda t} and found \\lambda must be Equation 4 by solving the characteristic equation. Using the superposition principle, the general solution is then \ny = a_1 e^{\\lambda_1 t} + a_2 e^{\\lambda_2 t}\n\\tag{5} The value of the constants a_1 and a_2 can be determined by the initial conditions, y(0)=y_0 and \\dot{y}(0) = v_0. Since the ODE is second-order, we need two initial conditions.\nNote in Equation 4 that if c^2 &lt; 4mk then \\lambda is complex! This has important implications on the solution behavior and will be discussed next.\n\n\n\nUndamped\nFirst let’s consider the undamped case by setting c=0. Then Equation 4 becomes \n\\lambda_{1,2} = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} i = \\pm \\omega_n i\n\\tag{6} where i \\equiv \\sqrt{-1} is the imaginary number and \\omega_n is known as the natural frequency of the system.\nWhat happens when \\lambda is imaginary? Recall Euler’s formula e^{ix} = \\cos x + i \\sin x. Substituting Equation 6 into Equation 5 and applying Euler’s formula yields\n\n\nShow Work\n\n\\begin{align*}\n  y &= a_1 e^{i\\omega_n t} + a_2 e^{-i\\omega_n t} \\\\\n    &= a_1 \\left( \\cos{\\omega_n t} + i \\sin{\\omega_n t} \\right) + a_2 \\left( \\cos{\\omega_n t} - i \\sin{\\omega_n t} \\right) \\\\\n    &= b_1 \\cos{\\omega_n t} + b_2 \\sin{\\omega_n t}\n  \\end{align*} where the definitions b_1 \\equiv a_1 + a_2 and b_2 \\equiv (a_1 - a_2) i are made.\nIn order for b_1 and b_2 to be real numbers, a_1 and a_2 must be complex conjugates of each other, a_2 = \\overline{a_1}.\nThe choice of variable names is arbitrary so we return to using a_1 and a_2 in the final equation.\n\n\ny = a_1 \\cos{\\omega_n t} + a_2 \\sin{\\omega_n t}\n\\tag{7} Once again we can solve for a_1 and a_2 given the initial conditions. This gives the final solution. \ny = y_0 \\cos{\\omega_n t} + \\frac{v_0}{\\omega_n} \\sin{\\omega_n t}\n\\tag{8}\nNow let’s explore the behavior of this solution via the interactive figure below.\n\n\n\n\nThrough this demo we’ve shown that the undamped solution is sinusoidal with frequency \\omega_n which is inherent to the system’s properties (mass and spring constant) and NOT the initial conditions.\nAn undamped system is unrealistic, however. There is always some source of friction or dissipation which decays motion. Next we’ll show how damping affects solution behavior.\n\n\nDamped\nRecall the solution, \\lambda_{1,2}, to the characteristic equation, Equation 4. We had hinted that the behavior of the solution depends on the magnitude of c^2 versus 4mk. In other words, the strength of the damping plays a critical role in the behavior of the MSD system.\nThe analysis is simplified if we introduce a new parameter \\zeta defined to be \n\\zeta \\equiv \\frac{c}{2m\\omega_n}\n where \\omega_n \\equiv \\sqrt{k/m} is the natural frequency from the undamped case. Using these definitions simplifies the characteristic roots: \n\\lambda_{1,2} = \\omega_n \\left( -\\zeta \\pm \\sqrt{\\zeta^2 - 1} \\right).\n Now it’s clear that the solution behavior (real or complex) only depends on the parameter \\zeta. Note \\zeta is essentially a non-dimensional damping coefficient.\nLet’s see how the solution changes now that we’ve introduced this new parameter.\n\n\n\n\nNow that we qualitatively understand the different behavior between under, over, and critically damped systems, let’s look into the specifics of each.\n\nUnderdamped\nFor \\zeta &lt; 1 the system is underdamped and the solution is oscillatory with an exponentially decaying amplitude. The solution for the underdamped system is\n\n\nShow Work\n\nFor \\zeta &lt; 1, \\lambda_{1,2} = -\\omega_n \\zeta \\pm \\omega_d i where \\omega_d \\equiv \\omega_n \\sqrt{1- \\zeta^2}. The roots are complex.\nSubstitute \\lambda into the unforced solution and we get \\begin{align*}\n      y &= a_1 e^{(-\\omega_n \\zeta + i \\omega_d) t} + a_2 e^{(-\\omega_n \\zeta - i \\omega_d) t} \\\\\n        &= e^{(-\\omega_n \\zeta)t} \\left( a_1 e^{i \\omega_d t} + a_2 e^{-i \\omega_d t} \\right) \\\\\n        &= e^{(-\\omega_n \\zeta)t} \\left( a_1' \\cos{\\omega_d t} + a_2' \\sin{\\omega_d t} \\right)\n    \\end{align*} where in the last step Euler’s formula was used and prime denotes new constants, similar to what was done for the undamped case.\n\n\ny = e^{-\\omega_n \\zeta t} \\left( a_1 \\cos \\omega_d t + a_2 \\sin \\omega_d t \\right)\n\\tag{9} where \n\\omega_d = \\omega_n \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}\n is the damped oscillation frequency. For low damping, \\zeta \\ll 1, the damped frequency is the same as the natural frequency. However, as damping increases the damped frequency decreases.\nThe exponential term e^{-\\omega_n \\zeta t} causes the oscillation amplitude to decay over time. In the demo we showed that this exponential term forms an envelope over the oscillations, representing the maximum amplitude of the oscillations at any time. We also showed that higher natural frequencies decay faster than lower natural frequencies.\nIn engineering, underdamping may be desired if quick response is desired (reaching y=0 fastest) and a little overshoot is okay. This is true for robotic arms where quick motion is essential and controllers can respond overshooting. Overdamping, conversely, can result in delayed response times.\n\n\nCritically Damped\nFor \\zeta = 1 the system is critically damped and the solution is non-oscillatory with fast exponential decay from initial conditions. This has the solution\n\n\nShow Work\n\nFor \\zeta = 1, \\lambda = -\\omega_n \\zeta. This corresponds with a double root of the characteristic equation. This means that we no longer have two linearly independent solutions and we have to find a new independent solution. This involves the reduction of order method which is beyond the scope of this lesson. For now, let’s assume it has the form y_2 = a_2 te^{\\lambda t}. Then using y_1 = a_1 e^{\\lambda t} we get \n      y = y_1 + y_2 = (a_1 + a_2 t)e^{-\\omega_n \\zeta t}\n    \n\n\ny = (a_1 + a_2 t) e^{-\\omega_n t}.\n\nThis solution corresponds with the least amount of time to reach stationary conditions. The solution can cross y=0 at most one time when a_1 + a_2 t = 0.\nA critically damped system is desired if you want motion damped quickly without oscillation. This is true for door closers. If underdamped, the door slams shut or oscillates. If overdamped, the door takes too long to close.\n\n\nOverdamped\nFor \\zeta &gt; 1 the solution is overdamped and is non-oscillatory with slow exponential decay from initial conditions. This has the solution\n\n\nShow Work\n\nFor \\zeta &gt; 1, \\lambda_{1,2} = -\\omega_n \\left( \\zeta \\pm \\sqrt{\\zeta^2-1} \\right) corresponding to two real roots. Substituting into the general solution gives \n      y = a_1 e^{-\\omega_n t \\left( \\zeta + \\sqrt{\\zeta^2-1}\\right)} + a_2 e^{-\\omega_n t \\left( \\zeta - \\sqrt{\\zeta^2-1} \\right)}\n    \n\n\ny = a_1 e^{-\\omega_n t \\left( \\zeta + \\sqrt{\\zeta^2-1}\\right)} + a_2 e^{-\\omega_n t \\left( \\zeta - \\sqrt{\\zeta^2-1} \\right)}\n\nThis has two decay rates: one fast and one slow with the slow rate dominating over long times and both interacting for short times.\nIn some cases, overdamping is desired. Industrial shock absorbers (end-of-stroke dampers) are commonly selected or adjusted so the overall response is near-critically damped or slightly overdamped, bringing a moving load to rest without oscillation or rebound. An underdamped (oscillatory) response can cause repeated impacts that damage nearby components or fixtures, so minimizing bounce is often the safer design choice.\nNext we’ll discuss the forced system, when f(t) \\neq 0."

    "section": "The Forced System",
    "text": "The Forced System\nIn the forced system, an external input f(t) continually injects energy into the system. This section focuses on periodic forcing, where the relationship between forcing frequency and the system’s natural frequency leads to resonance, beats, and a steady-state response with a well-defined amplitude and phase.\n\nUndamped\nPreviously we’ve only dealt with homogeneous ODEs. Now we have a nonhomogeneous ODE when f(t) \\neq 0. For linear nonhomogeneous ODEs we can get the general solution by adding a particular solution to the homogeneous solution. That is \ny(t) = y_h(t) + y_p(t)\n\\tag{10} where y_h = a_1 y_1 + a_2 y_2 is the homogeneous solution to Equation 2 with arbitrary constants, a_1 and a_2, (discussed previously in the unforced section) and y_p is a particular solution to Equation 1 with no arbitrary constants.\nGeneral methods for finding the particular solution are difficult and beyond the scope of this lesson. Instead we’ll only consider forcing of the form \nf(t) = f_0 \\cos \\omega_f t.\n which has many real-world implications. We’ve now introduced a new important parameter, \\omega_f, the forcing frequency. The forcing frequency interacts with the natural frequency of the system in interesting ways.\nTo understand this interaction between the forcing and natural frequency, let’s first consider the undamped system (c=0) with periodic forcing and its solution. The governing equation is \nm \\ddot{y} + k y = f_0 \\cos \\omega_f t\n\\tag{11} and the corresponding homogeneous solution was found previously, Equation 7. The particular solution is found using the method of undetermined coefficients. This method can only be applied if the force, f(t), has specific functional forms. If it meets this criterion, then the particular solution will be a known functional form with undetermined coefficients. For a sine or cosine function with frequency \\omega_f, the particular solution is \ny_p = b_1 \\cos{\\omega_f t} + b_2 \\sin{\\omega_f t}.\n\\tag{12} The undetermined coefficients, b_1 and b_2, are found by substituting the particular solution into Equation 11. This leads to a system of equations for the coefficients which is solved to yield \nb_1 = \\frac{f_0}{m\\left( \\omega_n^2 - \\omega_f^2 \\right)}, \\quad b_2 = 0.\n Then we superpose the homogeneous and particular solutions to get the general solution \ny(t) = a_1 \\cos{\\omega_n t} + a_2 \\sin{\\omega_n t} + \\frac{f_0}{m\\left( \\omega_n^2 - \\omega_f^2 \\right)} \\cos{\\omega_f t}\n\\tag{13} where \na_1 = y_0 - \\frac{f_0}{m\\left( \\omega_n^2 - \\omega_f^2 \\right)}, \\quad a_2 = \\frac{v_0}{\\omega_n}\n were found using the initial conditions. Note the coefficients go to infinity when \\omega_f = \\omega_n. In this situation we must assume a different form for the particular solution because y_p, Equation 12, is not linearly independent from y_h, Equation 7, when \\omega_f = \\omega_n. Instead we must choose a trial function \ny_p = b_1 t \\cos{\\omega_f t} + b_2 t \\sin{\\omega_f t}.\n Then we can repeat the process and get the general solution when the forcing and natural frequencies match: \ny(t) = a_1 \\cos{\\omega_n t} + a_2 \\sin{\\omega_n t} + \\frac{f_0}{2m\\omega_n} t \\sin{\\omega_n t}.\n\\tag{14}\nBelow is a demo to explore the behavior of the undamped solution. The solid line corresponds with the undamped solution (Equation 13 and Equation 14) and the dashed line corresponds with the envelope of this solution.\n\n\n\n\nThis demo demonstrated the concepts of resonance and beats.\nResonance occurs when the forcing frequency matches the natural frequency of the system. This results in amplification of the motion over time. This is similar to swinging. To increase your height, you propel yourself forward at the same time the swing starts to move forward. In other words, your forcing frequency is aligned with the swinging frequency. Resonance is also why singing at the right pitch (forcing frequency) can cause a glass (natural frequency) to break. In some cases resonance can be catastrophic. For tall buildings (or other large civil structures), wind can generate a forcing frequency which resonates with the building, capable of causing damage if oscillation amplitudes are large enough. In engines or other periodic forcing machines it’s important to make sure none of the other components have the same natural frequency as the forcing, otherwise vibrations could be amplified.\nBeats occur when the forcing frequency is close to the natural frequency. Because the forcing frequency and natural frequency of the system are slightly different, forces slowly go from in phase (amplification) to out of phase (cancellation), generating low frequency beats. Guitar tuning utilizes this feature. When you tune a guitar, you listen for beats (slow pulsing) that happens when the string and a reference note are slightly different in frequency. As you tune closer, the beat rate slows, and when the beats nearly disappear the pitches match.\n\n\nDamped\nZero damping is unrealistic. Real systems have some amount of damping. In this section we’ll introduce damping to the forced system and how it affects resonance.\nWith damping we will be solving \nm \\ddot{y} + c\\dot{y} + k y = f_0 \\cos(\\omega_f t)\n\\tag{15} and again the solution has homogeneous and particular parts. The particular solution is the same as the undamped case, Equation 12. For the transient (homogeneous) part we focus on the common lightly damped case \\zeta &lt; 1, so the homogeneous solution matches the unforced underdamped form in Equation 9.\nWe repeat the process as was done in the undamped case and get the general solution \ny(t) = y_h(t) + y_p(t)\n where \ny_h = e^{-\\omega_n \\zeta t} \\left( a_1 \\cos \\omega_d t + a_2 \\sin \\omega_d t \\right),\n with a_1 and a_2 determined from initial conditions and \ny_p = b_1 \\cos{\\omega_f t} + b_2 \\sin{\\omega_f t}\n with the coefficients \nb_1 = \\frac{(f_0/k)(1-r^2)}{(1-r^2)^2 + (2\\zeta r)^2}, \\quad b_2 = \\frac{(f_0/k)(2\\zeta r)}{(1-r^2)^2 + (2\\zeta r)^2}\n and r=\\omega_f/\\omega_n is the frequency ratio.\nNote now y_h decays to zero as t\\to \\infty as opposed to the undamped case where y_h is an undecaying sinusoid. This means that for long times (roughly after t \\gtrsim 3/(\\zeta \\omega_n)) after the initial motion the particular solution will dominate. Therefore, when considering damped resonance it is useful to only consider the particular solution and its maximum amplitude. This is often called practical resonance.\nWe can understand practical resonance by rewriting the particular solution (using trigonometric identities) as \ny_p = A \\cos (\\omega_f t - \\phi)\n where A is the amplitude of y_p and \\phi is the phase angle or phase lag because it measures the lag of the output behind the input. These are evaluated as \nA = \\sqrt{b_1^2 + b_2^2} = \\frac{f_0/k}{\\sqrt{(1-r^2)^2 + (2\\zeta r)^2}}, \\quad \\tan \\phi = \\frac{b_2}{b_1} = \\frac{2\\zeta r}{1-r^2}.\n\nLet’s now see how the response amplitude and phase are influenced by damping and forcing frequency via an interactive demo. The figure on the left plots amplitude versus the frequency ratio \\omega_f/\\omega_n. The response amplitude is normalized by the steady forcing displacement (f_0/k) and so a value greater than one corresponds with amplification relative to the input."

    "text": "Background\nThe mass-spring-damper (MSD) system is a simplified mathematical model of many real-world systems. Figure 1 shows the basic system considered. The objective is to find the motion of the mass as a function of time. The mass is connected to the wall via a spring which provides a restoring force when stretched and a resisting force when compressed. This motion is opposed by a damper, which is represented by wall friction in Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: MSD General Schematic\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 shows the MSD system at three different states: when the mass is at rest t&lt;0, the motion’s initial conditions t=0, and once motion begins t&gt;0. When the mass is at rest (in an equilibrium state), the spring is stretched by length L. It’s convenient to define our coordinate system, y, based on position of the mass at its rest state so that displacement represents the distance from equilibrium. At t=0, the mass is displaced by a distance y_0 with velocity v_0. This causes the mass to move for t &gt; 0. Once in motion, we can have either an unforced system or a forced system with the external force f(t).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: MSD Moving Schematic\n\n\n\n\nTo gain an understanding of the real-world applications, we’ll now consider four examples of MSD systems (shown in Figure 3 along with a table summary Table 1):\n\nDoor closer - Opening the door loads a spring in the door closer mechanism, storing energy; when released, the spring drives the door shut while a hydraulic piston forces oil through a small orifice, providing damping that prevents the door from slamming.\nBike front suspension - A bump compresses the fork, increasing pressure in the air chamber (spring) that stores energy and pushes the fork back out, while a hydraulic damper controls oil flow to limit how quickly the fork compresses and rebounds so the bike doesn’t bounce.\nBuilding - A building sways like a mass-spring-damper in wind or earthquakes, with the structure’s mass moving against the stiffness of columns/walls (spring) and energy lost through material/structural damping (damper). In extreme cases the wind forcing frequency can achieve resonance with the building’s natural frequency, which can have catastrophic consequences. Some very tall buildings counter this with a tuned mass damper (TMD).\nRLC circuit - An RLC circuit is the electrical analog of a mass-spring-damper, where inductance acts like mass (inertia), capacitance like a spring (stored energy), and resistance like damping (energy dissipation).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: MSD Real-World Examples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: MSD real-world examples and their physical analogies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\nMotion\nMass\nSpring\nDamper\nForce\n\n\n\n\nDoor Closer\npiston moving\ndoor\ninternal spring\nhydraulic damping\npushing door\n\n\nBike Suspension\nvertical motion of bike\nbike frame\ncoil/air spring\nhydraulic damper (oil)\nbumpy ground\n\n\nBuilding\nsway\nbuilding\nstiffness\nstructural damping\nwind\n\n\nRLC Circuit\ncurrent\ninductance\nelastance (1/C)\nresistor\napplied voltage",

    "section": "Governing Equation",
    "text": "Governing Equation\nTo derive the governing equation for the mass’s motion, we first write a force balance via a free body diagram. Figure 4 shows the forces acting on the mass. For positive displacement, y&gt;0, the spring is stretched and gives a force in the negative y direction. For negative displacement, the spring is compressed and gives a force in the positive y direction. In both cases the spring force opposes the displacement, which may be written as F_s = -ky where k is the spring constant. Similarly, the damper opposes the velocity of the mass. This is just like surface friction opposing the motion of a block sliding or drag slowing a ball thrown through the air. This gives the force F_d = -c \\dot{y}, where an overhead dot denotes a derivative with respect to time. The linear relationship between force and velocity is an approximation, but accurate for most applications. Finally the external force, f(t), is defined to be positive in the positive y direction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: MSD Free Body Diagram\n\n\n\n\nNext we apply Newton’s second law of motion \n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum F_y &= m a = m \\ddot{y} \\\\\n&= f(t) - k y - c \\dot{y}\n\\end{aligned}\n\nRewriting gives the final governing equation \nm \\ddot{y} + c \\dot{y} + k y = f(t)\n\\tag{1} This equation is a second-order, linear, nonhomogeneous ordinary differential equation (ODE) with constant coefficients. Let’s define each of these terms.\nThe order of an ODE is the highest order derivative in the equation. In this case \\ddot{y} is the highest order derivative, so the ODE is second order.\nAn ODE is linear if y and its derivatives appear only to the first power and are not multiplied together; coefficients may depend on the independent variable. For example, a(t)\\dot{y} is linear but y\\dot{y} is nonlinear. A principal feature of linear ODEs is solutions can be superposed.\nA homogeneous ODE is linear but with no external forcing term. The external force, f(t), in Equation 1 makes the equation nonhomogeneous. This distinction has important implications in solution strategies.\nAn ordinary differential equation only has derivatives with respect to one independent variable; as opposed to a partial differential equation which has derivatives with respect to two or more independent variables.\nEach of these classifications has a significant influence on solution properties and strategies. Next we’ll discuss the unforced system, f(t) = 0.",

    "text": "The Unforced System\nIn the unforced system, the motion is driven only by the initial displacement and velocity (no external force). This section shows how the solution depends on damping and how to interpret the resulting time response.\n\nAnalytical Solution\nIn the unforced system we set f = 0 in Equation 1 and get \nm \\ddot{y} + c \\dot{y} + k y = 0\n\\tag{2}\nThis equation is now homogeneous, allowing us to apply the superposition principle to obtain the general solution.\nIn general, homogeneous ODEs with constant coefficients admit exponential solutions, i.e. solutions of the form y(t) = a e^{\\lambda t} where \\lambda is the growth/decay rate and can be complex. For example, the first-order ODE \\dot{y}+by=0 yields exponential decay y = a e^{-bt} for b&gt;0.\nThis suggests we should try to solve Equation 2 assuming y = a e^{\\lambda t}. Substituting in Equation 2 yields \na m \\lambda^2 e^{\\lambda t} + a c \\lambda e^{\\lambda t} + a k e^{\\lambda t} = (m \\lambda^2 + c \\lambda + k)a e^{\\lambda t} = 0\n which is reduced to \nm \\lambda^2 + c \\lambda + k = 0.\n\\tag{3} Equation 3 is known as the characteristic equation. This can be solved using the quadratic formula \n\\lambda_{1,2} = \\frac{1}{2m}\\left( -c \\pm \\sqrt{c^2 - 4 m k} \\right)\n\\tag{4} where the subscript 1, 2 represents the fact there are two solutions to the characteristic equation corresponding to the “+” or “-” sign.\nWe’ve now solved the equation! We assumed y = a e^{\\lambda t} and found \\lambda must be Equation 4 by solving the characteristic equation. Using the superposition principle, the general solution is then \ny = a_1 e^{\\lambda_1 t} + a_2 e^{\\lambda_2 t}\n\\tag{5} The value of the constants a_1 and a_2 can be determined by the initial conditions, y(0)=y_0 and \\dot{y}(0) = v_0. Since the ODE is second-order, we need two initial conditions.\nNote in Equation 4 that if c^2 &lt; 4mk then \\lambda is complex! This has important implications on the solution behavior and will be discussed next.\n\n\n\nUndamped\nFirst let’s consider the undamped case by setting c=0. Then Equation 4 becomes \n\\lambda_{1,2} = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} i = \\pm \\omega_n i\n\\tag{6} where i \\equiv \\sqrt{-1} is the imaginary number and \\omega_n is known as the natural frequency of the system.\nWhat happens when \\lambda is imaginary? Recall Euler’s formula e^{ix} = \\cos x + i \\sin x. Substituting Equation 6 into Equation 5 and applying Euler’s formula yields\n\n\nShow Work\n\n\\begin{align*}\n  y &= a_1 e^{i\\omega_n t} + a_2 e^{-i\\omega_n t} \\\\\n    &= a_1 \\left( \\cos{\\omega_n t} + i \\sin{\\omega_n t} \\right) + a_2 \\left( \\cos{\\omega_n t} - i \\sin{\\omega_n t} \\right) \\\\\n    &= b_1 \\cos{\\omega_n t} + b_2 \\sin{\\omega_n t}\n  \\end{align*} where the definitions b_1 \\equiv a_1 + a_2 and b_2 \\equiv (a_1 - a_2) i are made.\nIn order for b_1 and b_2 to be real numbers, a_1 and a_2 must be complex conjugates of each other, a_2 = \\overline{a_1}.\nThe choice of variable names is arbitrary so we return to using a_1 and a_2 in the final equation.\n\n\ny = a_1 \\cos{\\omega_n t} + a_2 \\sin{\\omega_n t}\n\\tag{7} Once again we can solve for a_1 and a_2 given the initial conditions. This gives the final solution. \ny = y_0 \\cos{\\omega_n t} + \\frac{v_0}{\\omega_n} \\sin{\\omega_n t}\n\\tag{8}\nNow let’s explore the behavior of this solution via the interactive figure below.\n\n\n\n\nThrough this demo we’ve shown that the undamped solution is sinusoidal with frequency \\omega_n which is inherent to the system’s properties (mass and spring constant) and NOT the initial conditions.\nAn undamped system is unrealistic, however. There is always some source of friction or dissipation which decays motion. Next we’ll show how damping affects solution behavior.\n\n\nDamped\nRecall the solution, \\lambda_{1,2}, to the characteristic equation, Equation 4. We had hinted that the behavior of the solution depends on the magnitude of c^2 versus 4mk. In other words, the strength of the damping plays a critical role in the behavior of the MSD system.\nThe analysis is simplified if we introduce a new parameter \\zeta defined to be \n\\zeta \\equiv \\frac{c}{2m\\omega_n}\n where \\omega_n \\equiv \\sqrt{k/m} is the natural frequency from the undamped case. Using these definitions simplifies the characteristic roots: \n\\lambda_{1,2} = \\omega_n \\left( -\\zeta \\pm \\sqrt{\\zeta^2 - 1} \\right).\n Now it’s clear that the solution behavior (real or complex) only depends on the parameter \\zeta. Note \\zeta is essentially a non-dimensional damping coefficient.\nLet’s see how the solution changes now that we’ve introduced this new parameter.\n\n\n\n\nNow that we qualitatively understand the different behavior between under, over, and critically damped systems, let’s look into the specifics of each.\n\nUnderdamped\nFor \\zeta &lt; 1 the system is underdamped and the solution is oscillatory with an exponentially decaying amplitude. The solution for the underdamped system is\n\n\nShow Work\n\nFor \\zeta &lt; 1, \\lambda_{1,2} = -\\omega_n \\zeta \\pm \\omega_d i where \\omega_d \\equiv \\omega_n \\sqrt{1- \\zeta^2}. The characteristic roots are complex.\nSubstitute \\lambda into the unforced solution and we get \\begin{align*}\n      y &= a_1 e^{(-\\omega_n \\zeta + i \\omega_d) t} + a_2 e^{(-\\omega_n \\zeta - i \\omega_d) t} \\\\\n        &= e^{(-\\omega_n \\zeta)t} \\left( a_1 e^{i \\omega_d t} + a_2 e^{-i \\omega_d t} \\right) \\\\\n        &= e^{(-\\omega_n \\zeta)t} \\left( a_1' \\cos{\\omega_d t} + a_2' \\sin{\\omega_d t} \\right)\n    \\end{align*} where in the last step Euler’s formula was used and prime denotes new constants, similar to what was done for the undamped case.\n\n\ny = e^{-\\omega_n \\zeta t} \\left( a_1 \\cos \\omega_d t + a_2 \\sin \\omega_d t \\right)\n\\tag{9} where \n\\omega_d = \\omega_n \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}\n is the damped oscillation frequency. For low damping, \\zeta \\ll 1, the damped frequency is the same as the natural frequency. However, as damping increases the damped frequency decreases.\nThe exponential term e^{-\\omega_n \\zeta t} causes the oscillation amplitude to decay over time. In the demo we showed that this exponential term forms an envelope over the oscillations, representing the maximum amplitude of the oscillations at any time. We also showed that higher natural frequencies decay faster than lower natural frequencies.\nIn engineering, underdamping may be desired if quick response is desired (reaching y=0 fastest) and a little overshoot is okay. This is true for robotic arms where quick motion is essential and controllers can respond overshooting. Overdamping, conversely, can result in delayed response times.\n\n\nCritically Damped\nFor \\zeta = 1 the system is critically damped and the solution is non-oscillatory with fast exponential decay from initial conditions. This has the solution\n\n\nShow Work\n\nFor \\zeta = 1, \\lambda = -\\omega_n \\zeta. This corresponds with a double root of the characteristic equation. This means that we no longer have two linearly independent solutions and we have to find a new independent solution. This involves the reduction of order method which is beyond the scope of this lesson. For now, let’s assume it has the form y_2 = a_2 te^{\\lambda t}. Then using y_1 = a_1 e^{\\lambda t} we get \n      y = y_1 + y_2 = (a_1 + a_2 t)e^{-\\omega_n \\zeta t}\n    \n\n\ny = (a_1 + a_2 t) e^{-\\omega_n t}.\n\nThis solution corresponds with the least amount of time to reach stationary conditions. The solution can cross y=0 at most one time when a_1 + a_2 t = 0.\nA critically damped system is desired if you want motion damped quickly without oscillation. This is true for door closers. If underdamped, the door slams shut or oscillates. If overdamped, the door takes too long to close.\n\n\nOverdamped\nFor \\zeta &gt; 1 the solution is overdamped and is non-oscillatory with slow exponential decay from initial conditions. This has the solution\n\n\nShow Work\n\nFor \\zeta &gt; 1, \\lambda_{1,2} = -\\omega_n \\left( \\zeta \\pm \\sqrt{\\zeta^2-1} \\right) corresponding to two real characteristic roots. Substituting into the general solution gives \n      y = a_1 e^{-\\omega_n t \\left( \\zeta + \\sqrt{\\zeta^2-1}\\right)} + a_2 e^{-\\omega_n t \\left( \\zeta - \\sqrt{\\zeta^2-1} \\right)}\n    \n\n\ny = a_1 e^{-\\omega_n t \\left( \\zeta + \\sqrt{\\zeta^2-1}\\right)} + a_2 e^{-\\omega_n t \\left( \\zeta - \\sqrt{\\zeta^2-1} \\right)}\n\nThis has two decay rates: one fast and one slow with the slow rate dominating over long times and both interacting for short times.\nIn some cases, overdamping is desired. Industrial shock absorbers (end-of-stroke dampers) are commonly selected or adjusted so the overall response is near-critically damped or slightly overdamped, bringing a moving load to rest without oscillation or rebound. An underdamped (oscillatory) response can cause repeated impacts that damage nearby components or fixtures, so minimizing bounce is often the safer design choice.\nNext we’ll discuss the forced system, when f(t) \\neq 0.",

    "section": "The Forced System",
    "text": "The Forced System\nIn the forced system, an external input f(t) continually injects energy into the system. This section focuses on periodic forcing, where the relationship between forcing frequency and the system’s natural frequency leads to resonance, beats, and a steady-state response with a well-defined amplitude and phase.\n\nUndamped\nPreviously we’ve only dealt with homogeneous ODEs. Now we have a nonhomogeneous ODE when f(t) \\neq 0. For linear nonhomogeneous ODEs we can get the general solution by adding a particular solution to the homogeneous solution. That is \ny(t) = y_h(t) + y_p(t)\n\\tag{10} where y_h = a_1 y_1 + a_2 y_2 is the homogeneous solution to Equation 2 with arbitrary constants, a_1 and a_2, (discussed previously in the unforced section) and y_p is a particular solution to Equation 1 with no arbitrary constants.\nGeneral methods for finding the particular solution are difficult and beyond the scope of this lesson. Instead we’ll only consider forcing of the form \nf(t) = f_0 \\cos \\omega_f t.\n which has many real-world implications. We’ve now introduced a new important parameter, \\omega_f, the forcing frequency. The forcing frequency interacts with the natural frequency of the system in interesting ways.\nTo understand this interaction between the forcing and natural frequency, let’s first consider the undamped system (c=0) with periodic forcing and its solution. The governing equation is \nm \\ddot{y} + k y = f_0 \\cos \\omega_f t\n\\tag{11} and the corresponding homogeneous solution was found previously, Equation 7. The particular solution is found using the method of undetermined coefficients. This method can only be applied if the force, f(t), has specific functional forms. If it meets this criterion, then the particular solution will be a known functional form with undetermined coefficients. For a sine or cosine function with frequency \\omega_f, the particular solution is \ny_p = b_1 \\cos{\\omega_f t} + b_2 \\sin{\\omega_f t}.\n\\tag{12} The undetermined coefficients, b_1 and b_2, are found by substituting the particular solution into Equation 11. This leads to a system of equations for the coefficients which is solved to yield \nb_1 = \\frac{f_0}{m\\left( \\omega_n^2 - \\omega_f^2 \\right)}, \\quad b_2 = 0.\n Then we superpose the homogeneous and particular solutions to get the general solution \ny(t) = a_1 \\cos{\\omega_n t} + a_2 \\sin{\\omega_n t} + \\frac{f_0}{m\\left( \\omega_n^2 - \\omega_f^2 \\right)} \\cos{\\omega_f t}\n\\tag{13} where \na_1 = y_0 - \\frac{f_0}{m\\left( \\omega_n^2 - \\omega_f^2 \\right)}, \\quad a_2 = \\frac{v_0}{\\omega_n}\n were found using the initial conditions. Note the coefficients go to infinity when \\omega_f = \\omega_n. In this situation we must assume a different form for the particular solution because y_p, Equation 12, is not linearly independent from y_h, Equation 7, when \\omega_f = \\omega_n. Instead we must choose a trial function \ny_p = b_1 t \\cos{\\omega_f t} + b_2 t \\sin{\\omega_f t}.\n Then we can repeat the process and get the general solution when the forcing and natural frequencies match: \ny(t) = a_1 \\cos{\\omega_n t} + a_2 \\sin{\\omega_n t} + \\frac{f_0}{2m\\omega_n} t \\sin{\\omega_n t}.\n\\tag{14}\nBelow is a demo to explore the behavior of the undamped solution. The solid line corresponds with the undamped solution (Equation 13 and Equation 14) and the dashed line corresponds with the envelope of this solution.\n\n\n\n\nThis demo demonstrated the concepts of resonance and beats.\nResonance occurs when the forcing frequency matches the natural frequency of the system. This results in amplification of the motion over time. This is similar to swinging. To increase your height, you propel yourself forward at the same time the swing starts to move forward. In other words, your forcing frequency is aligned with the swinging frequency. Resonance is also why singing at the right pitch (forcing frequency) can cause a glass (natural frequency) to break. In some cases resonance can be catastrophic. For tall buildings (or other large civil structures), wind can generate a forcing frequency which resonates with the building, capable of causing damage if oscillation amplitudes are large enough. In engines or other periodic forcing machines it’s important to make sure none of the other components have the same natural frequency as the forcing, otherwise vibrations could be amplified.\nBeats occur when the forcing frequency is close to the natural frequency. Because the forcing frequency and natural frequency of the system are slightly different, forces slowly go from in phase (amplification) to out of phase (cancellation), generating low frequency beats. Guitar tuning utilizes this feature. When you tune a guitar, you listen for beats (slow pulsing) that happens when the string and a reference note are slightly different in frequency. As you tune closer, the beat rate slows, and when the beats nearly disappear the pitches match.\n\n\nDamped\nZero damping is unrealistic. Real systems have some amount of damping. In this section we’ll introduce damping to the forced system and how it affects resonance.\nWith damping we will be solving \nm \\ddot{y} + c\\dot{y} + k y = f_0 \\cos(\\omega_f t)\n\\tag{15} and again the solution has homogeneous and particular parts. The particular solution is the same as the undamped case, Equation 12. For the transient (homogeneous) part we focus on the common lightly damped case \\zeta &lt; 1, so the homogeneous solution matches the unforced underdamped form in Equation 9.\nWe repeat the process as was done in the undamped case and get the general solution \ny(t) = y_h(t) + y_p(t)\n where \ny_h = e^{-\\omega_n \\zeta t} \\left( a_1 \\cos \\omega_d t + a_2 \\sin \\omega_d t \\right),\n with a_1 and a_2 determined from initial conditions and \ny_p = b_1 \\cos{\\omega_f t} + b_2 \\sin{\\omega_f t}\n with the coefficients \nb_1 = \\frac{(f_0/k)(1-r^2)}{(1-r^2)^2 + (2\\zeta r)^2}, \\quad b_2 = \\frac{(f_0/k)(2\\zeta r)}{(1-r^2)^2 + (2\\zeta r)^2}\n and r=\\omega_f/\\omega_n is the frequency ratio.\nNote now y_h decays to zero as t\\to \\infty as opposed to the undamped case where y_h is an undecaying sinusoid. This means that for long times (roughly after t \\gtrsim 3/(\\zeta \\omega_n)) after the initial motion the particular solution will dominate. Therefore, when considering damped resonance it is useful to only consider the particular solution and its maximum amplitude. This is often called practical resonance.\nWe can understand practical resonance by rewriting the particular solution (using trigonometric identities) as \ny_p = A \\cos (\\omega_f t - \\phi)\n where A is the amplitude of y_p and \\phi is the phase angle or phase lag because it measures the lag of the output behind the input. These are evaluated as \nA = \\sqrt{b_1^2 + b_2^2} = \\frac{f_0/k}{\\sqrt{(1-r^2)^2 + (2\\zeta r)^2}}, \\quad \\tan \\phi = \\frac{b_2}{b_1} = \\frac{2\\zeta r}{1-r^2}.\n\nLet’s now see how the response amplitude and phase are influenced by damping and forcing frequency via an interactive demo. The figure on the left plots amplitude versus the frequency ratio \\omega_f/\\omega_n. The response amplitude is normalized by the steady forcing displacement (f_0/k) and so a value greater than one corresponds with amplification relative to the input.",

    "text": "Background\nThe objective of this work is to predict the “separation location” for flow over a prolate spheroid. Figure 1 provides a schematic picture of this flow. Flow hits the spheroid with some angle of attack (AOA) or drift angle, \\beta.\nThen a viscous layer forms on surface called a boundary layer. The adverse pressure gradient slows the boundary layer until the momentum of the fluid isn’t enough to remain attached. The flow separates and a pair of counter-rotating vortices are generated at the separation location. These vortices advect downstream, forming a vortex sheet as new vortices are generated.\nThis vortex sheet is called the wake and it plays a huge role in the forces felt on the body. And the separation location, being the starting point of wake development, plays a critical role in force and moment predicts on bodies like this. The separation location is a function of the axial coordinate, X, and the azimuthal angle, \\phi.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Schematic of flow separation and the resulting wake for flow over a prolate spheroid\n\n\n\nFigure Figure 2 shows “closed” versus “open” separation. Closed separation has a continuous separation curve and forms a wake similar to a separation bubble. Open separation, conversely, does not have a continuously connected separation curve and two vortex sheets, as described previously. Flow over spheroid can have either closed or open separation depending on the AOA or drift angle. Low drift angles have closed separation whereas high drift angles have open separation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Schematic of closed versus open separation\n\n\n\nFigure 3 shows a flow chart of the separation model considered in this work. The separation model is based on solving the integral boundary layer equations along streamlines. It has two parts, an inviscid solver based on potential flow theory and a viscous solver based on the boundary layer equations. They are at a minimum one-way coupled where the inviscid solver provides the velocity as a boundary conditon to the viscous solver. Sometimes they are two-way coupled where the displacement thickness, \\delta^*, (computed from the viscous solver) is used as a transpiration boundary condition on the inviscid solver. Only one-way coupling is considered in this work.\nThe viscous solver then outputs boundary layer quantities like the boundary layer thickness, momentum thickness, displacement thickness, and most importantly the wall stress, \\tau_w. In the context of this work, separation will be defined as the point where the skin friction or wall stress is zero. This definition is not general and is rather a property of the model itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Separation model flow chart",

More general methods are possible and will be considered in future work. Figure 4 shows the inviscid velocity for axial flow (flow aligned in X direction), cross flow (flow aligned in Y or Z direction), and rotational flow (flow rotates about the Y or Z axis). The velocity for the axial flow is nearly equal its free stream value because the body is considered slender (length is much larger than diameter). The velocity for the cross flow is very close to inviscid flow over a cylinder, again because the body is slender. And the azimuthal velocity for the rotational flow is similar to the velocity of solid body rotation.\nThe velocity fields for each of these flows (axial, cross, and rotational) can be superposed to form any type of flow scenario we want. For this work we will primarily be interested in flow at a drift angle (axial + cross) and turning flow (axial + cross + rotational).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Inviscid velocity for axial, cross, and rotational flows\n\n\n\nOnce the inviscid velocity field is computed we can compute the corresponding streamlines by integrating the velocity vector field.

Figure 9 compares the separation location for the turn case versus the drift case (no rotation) from before. The effect of rotation on the separation location is complex, with trends being non-monotonic. For high drift angles, turning delays separation whereas for low drift angles, turning causes separation to occur earlier. Further testing needs to be done to validate whether this actually occurs for high fidelity solvers (like RANS, LES, etc.) or if this is just a feature of the model which needs to be improved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Separation model predictions for 6:1 prolate spheroid “turning”",
